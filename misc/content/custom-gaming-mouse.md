<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/custom-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=custom-gaming-mouse&utm_term=redragon-rgb-wireless-gaming-mouse-impact-elite-m913-20-programmable-buttons-12-side-buttons-mmo-mou-1"><img alt="redragon-rgb-wireless-gaming-mouse-impact-elite-m913-20-programmable-buttons-12-side-buttons-mmo-mou-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/redragon-rgb-wireless-gaming-mouse-impact-elite-m913-20-programmable-buttons-12-side-buttons-mmo-mou-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

In my daily gaming routine, I've had the pleasure of using the Redragon RGB Wireless Gaming Mouse Impact Elite M913. The 20 programmable buttons, with a whopping 12 side buttons designed for MMO games, have really made it stand out. The quick switch between wired and wireless modes has made it incredibly versatile, and the near-instantaneous response time of 1ms ensures that my clicks and swipes are always registered accurately. The mouse's size and ergonomic design fit my hand perfectly, adding comfort to its performance. 

However, there are a couple of downsides. The software that comes with it has a learning curve and might not be user-friendly for everyone. Additionally, the battery life of 45 hours is on the lower end for a Wireless gaming mouse. 

Taking it all into account, the Redragon RGB Wireless M913 Gaming Mouse Impact Elite is a solid option for a right-handed gamer who doesn't mind a bit of a learning curve with the software or the need to charge the battery more often than some other models.

I've been using the Razer Naga V2 HyperSpeed for a few months now and let me tell you, it's been quite the adventure. As an avid gamer, I was excited to try out this wireless ergonomic MMO mouse with its 19 buttons and dual-mode scroll wheel. I have to start by mentioning its impressively long battery life - it can last up to 400 hours on HyperSpeed Wireless! 

This mouse has truly transformed my gameplay experience. The side buttons are incredibly responsive, allowing me to execute skill rotations with ease and speed during intense raids. The build quality is impressive; it feels solid in my hand without being too heavy. Setting up was a breeze, even for someone who isn't tech-savvy. 

Now, onto the cons. The software took some time figuring out, but after getting some guidance from Razer support, I was able to customize and save my macros smoothly. Additionally, while the battery life is excellent, the fact that it doesn't come with a rechargeable option might be a bummer for some users. 

In summary, the Razer Naga V2 HyperSpeed has not only met but exceeded my expectations as an MMO gamer. Its combination of customizable buttons, comfortable design, and reliable performance makes it the perfect companion for any gaming sessions.

Finally, the Razer Optical Mouse Switches Gen-3 combine unrivaled durability and speed, boasting a 90-million click lifecycle with zero double-clicking issues and a blistering 0.2ms actuation speed. This paired with the next-gen wireless charging capability compatible with Razer wireless chargers and other Qi chargers, makes this mouse an absolute joy to use. 

However, there are some drawbacks to consider. The mouse is a bit heavier than many other wireless mice, which might not suit everyone's preference. Also, the price point might be steep for some, but considering the superior performance and customization options it offers, it's worth every penny. 

In conclusion, if you're serious about upping your game, investing in the Razer Basilisk V3 Pro Customizable Wireless Gaming Mouse is definitely a step in the right direction.

I've been using the Pwnage Ultra Custom Symmetrical Gaming Mouse for about three months now and I must say, it's been an enjoyable experience. The custom weight and balancing system is a game-changer, as I can easily adjust the mouse according to my gameplay style. I appreciate how lightweight it is, giving me fast movements and better precision in my games. 

One feature that really stands out is the removable top & button covers, which allow me to customize the appearance of my mouse. The RGB lighting adds a nice touch, making it look quite stylish on my desk. However, I would've preferred if the lighting was customizable to match any color scheme I wanted. 

As for the cons, there's only one issue that I've encountered so far. The customer support was rather disappointing when I reached out to them regarding a minor defect with the product. They didn't cover the issue under their manufacturer warranty because it was purchased from a third-party retailer like Amazon, which I found frustrating. 

Overall, the Pwnage Ultra Custom Symmetrical Gaming Mouse has made a significant difference in my gaming experience. Its customizable features, ergonomic design, and impressive performance make it worth considering if you're in the market for a high-quality gaming mouse.

Each sensor type has its advantages, but personal preferences and individual needs will determine which is best for you. 


### Can I wash or clean the custom gaming mouse?

Yes, you can clean your custom gaming mouse. Use a clean cloth or microfiber towel with a small amount of rubbing alcohol or disinfecting wipes.
