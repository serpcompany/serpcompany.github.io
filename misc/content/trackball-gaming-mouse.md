### [Wired Thumb-Operated Trackball Mouse (ELECOM EX-G)](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/trackball-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=trackball-gaming-mouse&utm_term=wired-thumb-operated-trackball-mouse-elecom-ex-g)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/trackball-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=trackball-gaming-mouse&utm_term=elecom-wired-thumb-operated-trackball-mouse-5-button-function-with-smooth-tracking-precision-optical-1"><img alt="elecom-wired-thumb-operated-trackball-mouse-5-button-function-with-smooth-tracking-precision-optical-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/elecom-wired-thumb-operated-trackball-mouse-5-button-function-with-smooth-tracking-precision-optical-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

From my own experience, I've found the Elecom Wired Thumb-Operated Trackball Mouse to be quite comfortable and easy to use. The ergonomic design is a game-changer, making it effortless to navigate through my work or gaming activities without straining my wrist. The adjustable pointer speeds add an extra layer of convenience, allowing me to switch between fast and slow movements based on my preference. 

One thing that impresses me a lot is the durability of its buttons, which are made by OMRON. The high count resolution ensures smooth scrolling and precision tracking on various surfaces. Plus, cleaning the trackball is a breeze - just remove the ball and give it a swipe! 

However, there's one limitation - it doesn't work with older CPU switchboards. While it's not a deal-breaker for me, some users might find this inconvenient. Nonetheless, its compatibility with both Windows and macOS systems makes it versatile enough for most people's needs. 

In summary, the Elecom Wired Thumb-Operated Trackball Mouse is an excellent choice for those who are looking for a comfortable, durable, and precise input device with customizable buttons and adjustable DPI.

Its ergonomic design has been a real game-changer for me. After long hours at the computer, my wrist no longer aches, and I can type away with ease. 

What really stands out is its performance. The high-quality optical system provides smooth tracking, and the adjustable DPI lets me fine-tune settings for optimal accuracy. I also appreciate the six programmable buttons, which allow me to customize the mouse according to my needs. 

One downside, however, is its size. While not bulky, it does take up more space than a regular mouse. Additionally, the learning curve for operating the trackball may not be everyone's cup of tea. 

Overall, the Elecom Wireless Trackball offers an enjoyable and highly customizable experience. It's perfect for gamers and designers alike who seek precision and comfort. If you're ready to change up your mouse game, I'd highly recommend giving this one a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/trackball-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=trackball-gaming-mouse&utm_term=perixx-perimice-520-wired-usb-ergonomic-trackball-mouse-adjustable-angle-8-button-design-white-1"><img alt="perixx-perimice-520-wired-usb-ergonomic-trackball-mouse-adjustable-angle-8-button-design-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/perixx-perimice-520-wired-usb-ergonomic-trackball-mouse-adjustable-angle-8-button-design-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks back, I decided to give the Perixx PERIMICE-520 a shot for my daily work routine due to its adjustable angle, programmable buttons, and durable design. Upon receiving the package, I was excited to see the beautiful white color that complemented my setup. 

The sculpted ergonomic shape and adjustable mouse risers were a game changer. Being able to switch between three different angles allowed me to find the perfect position that alleviated the strain on my hand when using a mouse all day. 

The removable gray trackball not only facilitates seamless cursor control but also adds a touch of elegance to your workspace, while the tilted scroll wheel lets you navigate both vertically and horizontally with ease. 

However, the low rating for this mouse comes from the durability of the attachable mouse risers, which seem to be made of cheaper materials that could wear out over time. Also, some users might prefer a more responsive scroll wheel without tilting functionality. 

In conclusion, the Perixx PERIMICE-520 offers an ergonomic design with an adjustable angle that's perfect for extending your comfort during long working hours. Its programmable buttons provide personalized control for various tasks, making it a strong contender in the world of wired trackball mice. However, potential buyers should keep in mind the possible drawbacks regarding durability and the unique scroll wheel design.

Scrolling through documents or web pages with this mouse is a smooth experience, as my thumb can easily control the scrolling function. However, I did experience a minor issue regarding the build quality of the mouse. It seems that after a year of usage, the mouse tends to malfunction or cease functioning altogether. 

Another downside is that the mouse takes some getting used to in order to get the hang of operating it. Despite these cons, I find the Image Wireless Finger Handheld USB Trackball Mouse with Laser Pointer to be a comfortable and ergonomic option that has genuinely improved my productivity and overall enjoyment while using my computer. 

The highlight of this product is undoubtedly its unique design, which has greatly reduced the strain on my wrist and fingers.

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/trackball-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=trackball-gaming-mouse&utm_term=trackball-gaming-mouse-4"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Trackball+Gaming+Mouse-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Trackball Gaming Mouse-4"></a></div>

A Trackball Gaming Mouse is a type of computer mouse designed specifically for gaming enthusiasts. It features a trackball, which is a small ball that protrudes from the top or side of the mouse, allowing the user to control the cursor by rotating the ball with their thumb, fingers, or palm. Unlike traditional mice, trackball gaming mice are often more ergonomic and provide increased precision and control during gameplay. 


### Why should I consider using a Trackball Gaming Mouse?

Trackball Gaming Mice offer several advantages over traditional mice. They are more ergonomic, which can help reduce strain on your wrist and fingers during extended gaming sessions. Trackball mice also offer higher precision and control, which can give you an edge in competitive gaming scenarios. Additionally, they don't require as much space on your desk as a regular mouse, making them a space-saving option for gamers with limited desk space. 


### How do I set up a Trackball Gaming Mouse?

Setting up a Trackball Gaming Mouse is typically a simple process. First, connect the mouse to your computer using the supplied USB cable or wireless receiver. Next, you may need to install any necessary software or drivers from the manufacturer's website. Once connected, configure your mouse settings within your computer's operating system or the game's settings to optimize performance for your specific gaming needs. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/trackball-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=trackball-gaming-mouse&utm_term=trackball-gaming-mouse-5"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Trackball+Gaming+Mouse-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Trackball Gaming Mouse-5"></a></div>


### How do I clean a Trackball Gaming Mouse?

Cleaning a Trackball Gaming Mouse is important to maintain optimal performance. Begin by unplugging or turning off the mouse. Use a lint-free cloth to gently wipe down the exterior of the mouse, removing any dust or dirt. Next, carefully remove the trackball by twisting it counterclockwise, and use a soft brush or compressed air to remove any debris from inside the trackball chamber. Finally, replace the trackball and turn the mouse back on. Regular cleaning will help prolong the life of your gaming mouse and ensure smooth performance. 


### Which games are best suited for a Trackball Gaming Mouse?

Trackball Gaming Mice can be used in various game genres, such as first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). However, they may excel in certain types of games that require precision control, rapid response times, and a high level of accuracy. Some examples include FPS games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Overwatch, as well as RTS games like Starcraft II or Age of Empires. 


### What is the difference between optical and laser Trackball Gaming Mice?

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/trackball-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=trackball-gaming-mouse&utm_term=trackball-gaming-mouse-6"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Trackball+Gaming+Mouse-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Trackball Gaming Mouse-6"></a></div>

The main difference between optical and laser Trackball Gaming Mice lies in their sensor technology. Optical mice use an LED and light-sensitive detector to track movement, while laser mice use a laser to achieve better tracking accuracy and sensitivity. As a result, laser mice are often more precise and can track on a wider range of surfaces than optical mice. However, this added precision may not be necessary for all users, and some may prefer the affordability and simplicity of optical trackball mice. 


### Can I use a Trackball Gaming Mouse with a laptop?

Yes, you can use a Trackball Gaming Mouse with a laptop, provided it has a USB port or is compatible with a wireless receiver. Simply connect the mouse to your laptop, and you should be able to use it like any other USB device. Note that some laptops have limited USB ports, so you may need to use a USB hub or remove other USB devices to accommodate your new gaming mouse. 


### How do I customize button assignments on a Trackball Gaming Mouse?

Many Trackball Gaming Mice allow users to customize button assignments to suit their individual gaming preferences. To do this, you will typically need to install the manufacturer's software or driver, which often includes a program that enables you to reassign buttons or create custom profiles for specific games. Follow the software's instructions to customize your button assignments, and remember to save your settings to ensure they persist across different gaming sessions.
