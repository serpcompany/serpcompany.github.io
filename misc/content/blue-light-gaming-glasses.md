### [Premium Blue Light Blocking Computer and Gamer Glasses by Glassy](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=premium-blue-light-blocking-computer-and-gamer-glasses-by-glassy)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=glassy-mikemo-premium-blue-light-blocking-glasses-anti-eyestrain-and-fatigue-glasses-for-computer-an-1"><img alt="glassy-mikemo-premium-blue-light-blocking-glasses-anti-eyestrain-and-fatigue-glasses-for-computer-an-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glassy-mikemo-premium-blue-light-blocking-glasses-anti-eyestrain-and-fatigue-glasses-for-computer-an-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using Glassy's Mikemo Premium Blue Light Blocking Computer and Gaming Glasses regularly, I can confidently say that they have made a significant difference in my daily routine. The modern design with the TR90 frame is not only stylish but also comfortable, making them perfect for long hours spent in front of a screen. The glasses effectively block blue light, reducing eye strain and fatigue. I can attest to their 100% UV protection and impact resistance, as I've been using them during intense gaming sessions without any issues. 

However, there is one drawback that I would like to mention. Due to the size of my nose, I find the glasses a bit too big for me, causing them to slip down my face occasionally. I reached out to Glassy's customer support for assistance, but unfortunately, I did not receive a response. Overall, I believe that these glasses provide excellent value for their price, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish solution to combat eye strain from screens. 


### [Razer Anzu Smart Glasses for Enhanced Gaming Experience](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=razer-anzu-smart-glasses-for-enhanced-gaming-experience)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=razer-anzu-smart-glasses-rectangle-blue-light-sunglass-l-1"><img alt="razer-anzu-smart-glasses-rectangle-blue-light-sunglass-l-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-rectangle-blue-light-sunglass-l-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Razer Anzu smart glasses for about a month now, and let me tell you, these glasses have blown me away! The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek design. They look like regular glasses, but with a hidden twist - built-in speakers and microphone. It's like having your own personal sound system right on your face! 

Now, coming to the performance of these glasses, the blue light filtering or polarized sunglass lenses are an absolute game-changer. I work from home and spend hours in front of my computer screen, which can be really tiring for the eyes. With the Razer Anzu, my eyes feel much less strained and fatigued at the end of the day. Plus, the polarized lenses provide excellent protection from the sun when I venture outdoors. 

The low latency audio is another highlight. The 60ms Bluetooth connection ensures that the sound is smooth and stutter-free, making gaming or watching movies more immersive than ever. And let's not forget the touch-enabled controls and voice assistant compatibility. It's so convenient to manage my music, answer calls, or even ask my phone for directions without touching it. 

However, there are a few cons to these glasses. The battery life, while decent, could be better. It lasts around 5 hours, which is enough for a day's use, but I wish it could go longer. Also, the glasses are not very comfortable for extended periods of use. The plush leatherette cushion is supposed to reduce wrist strain during gaming marathons, but I've found my ears getting sore after wearing them for a few hours. 

On top of that, the build quality of these glasses seems to be a hit or miss. Some users have reported issues with the hinges, which is concerning. However, I haven't experienced any problems with mine yet. 

In conclusion, the Razer Anzu smart glasses are a revolutionary product for anyone who loves technology and wants to up their eyewear game. The blue light filtering or polarized sunglass lenses, low latency audio, and touch-enabled controls make these glasses a joy to use. While there are some cons to consider, such as the battery life and build quality, the overall experience has been positive. I would definitely recommend giving these glasses a try! 


### [Festive Chestnut Frame Blue Light Blocking Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=festive-chestnut-frame-blue-light-blocking-glasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=blue-light-blocking-glasses-festive-chestnut-frame-cat-eye-computer-gaming-glasses-winston-by-diff-e-1"><img alt="blue-light-blocking-glasses-festive-chestnut-frame-cat-eye-computer-gaming-glasses-winston-by-diff-e-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/blue-light-blocking-glasses-festive-chestnut-frame-cat-eye-computer-gaming-glasses-winston-by-diff-e-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I remember the day I got my Winston glasses by Diff Eyewear, it was a game-changer for me. As someone who spends most of their time staring at screens, I always struggled with eye strain and headaches. But these glasses were a life-saver. 

The first thing that caught my eye was the cat-eye design. It's a classic look that never goes out of style, and it's surprisingly flattering on almost every face shape. The color is subtle but adds a touch of elegance that makes these glasses perfect for any occasion. 

One of the things I love most about the Winston glasses is how comfortable they are. They're made from acetate, which is lightweight but durable, so you don't have to worry about them breaking easily. Plus, they're adjustable, so you can get the perfect fit. 

Another thing I really appreciate is the blue light technology. These glasses are specifically designed to block out harmful blue light from screens, which can cause eye strain and other issues. I can definitely tell the difference when I'm wearing them - my eyes feel less tired at the end of the day, and I don't get as many headaches. 

Of course, no product is perfect, and there are a couple of things I wish were different about the Winston glasses. For one, they can feel a little heavy after wearing them for a while. And while the color is lovely, it might not be everyone's cup of tea. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my Winston glasses by Diff Eyewear. They're stylish, comfortable, and effective at reducing eye strain and headaches. If you're someone who spends a lot of time in front of screens, I highly recommend giving these glasses a try. 


### [E-sports ProGear Blue Blocking Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=e-sports-progear-blue-blocking-gaming-glasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=e-sports-gaming-glasses-or-fitover-blue-blocker-progear-e-sports-x-treme-1"><img alt="e-sports-gaming-glasses-or-fitover-blue-blocker-progear-e-sports-x-treme-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/e-sports-gaming-glasses-or-fitover-blue-blocker-progear-e-sports-x-treme-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

E-sports Gaming Glasses, also known as the ProGear E-sports X-Treme, have been my go-to accessory for those extended gaming sessions. I didn't realize how much strain the blue light from screens could put on my eyes until I started using these glasses. The custom lens tints filter out the harmful blue light and block UV rays, making it easier for me to distinguish contrasts on the screen. 

The first feature that stood out to me was the comfort. These glasses are so lightweight, I forget I'm wearing them until I take them off. The adjustable nose bridge ensures a snug fit, reducing any strain on my ears. I've even found that they help lessen my gamer headaches and eye strain, allowing me to play for longer periods without any discomfort. 

However, one con to note is the yellow tint. While it effectively blocks out blue light, the color adjustment can take a little getting used to. Additionally, while the glasses are comfortable for several hours, they might start to feel a bit tight after extended use. 

All in all, the ProGear E-sports Gaming Glasses have significantly improved my gaming experience. They're affordable, comfortable, and most importantly, protect my eyes from harmful blue light. If you're a gamer looking for a solution to reduce eye strain and headaches, these glasses are definitely worth considering. 


### [GUDVUE Ultra-Light Blue Light Blocking Gaming Sunglasses for Women/Men](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gudvue-ultra-light-blue-light-blocking-gaming-sunglasses-for-womenmen)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gudvue-blue-light-glasses-ultra-lightweight-oval-eyeglasses-computer-reading-gaming-tv-phones-glasse-1"><img alt="gudvue-blue-light-glasses-ultra-lightweight-oval-eyeglasses-computer-reading-gaming-tv-phones-glasse-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gudvue-blue-light-glasses-ultra-lightweight-oval-eyeglasses-computer-reading-gaming-tv-phones-glasse-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a busy gamer who spends long hours in front of screens, I've been looking for the perfect pair of blue light blocking glasses. I recently tried GUDVUE's Ultra Lightweight Oval Eyeglasses and I must say, they've made my gaming sessions significantly more comfortable and eye-friendly. 

The first thing that struck me about these glasses was their super light weight. Imagine wearing an eyemask - it's lighter than that! The minimalist design, with a low nose bridge and arc-shaped temples, makes them incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods. 

However, not every feature was as impressive. The main drawback I experienced was the lack of durability. The screw on one of the temples came loose after just a few days of use, which wasn't exactly ideal given how often I need to take them on and off during gaming sessions. 

In summary, GUDVUE's Ultra Lightweight Oval Eyeglasses offer a stylish and effective solution to preventing eye strain from blue light exposure. While they may not be the most durable choice out there, their light weight and comfortable design make them worth considering if you're in the market for blue light blocking glasses.

Right out of the box, my daughter was thrilled with how fun and fashionable these glasses looked. She couldn't wait to show them off to her friends. But more importantly, she noticed a significant difference in how her eyes felt after hours of screen time. 

The proprietary blue light blocking technology is truly impressive. It effectively shields against 100 percent of UV light, reducing glare and reflections on the screen, making it easier for her to see without squinting. No more headaches or watery eyes after binge-watching her favorite shows! 

One of the things that stood out the most about these glasses was their comfort level. The lightweight and comfortable frames make wearing them for extended periods of time a breeze. Plus, the red fade design adds a trendy touch that my daughter absolutely loves. 

There were a few minor drawbacks, though. For instance, the glasses might be a little tight for some older kids. Also, they don't seem to fit perfectly on certain types of screens, such as larger computer monitors. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the performance of these Screen Shades Kids' Blue Light Blocking Glasses Red Fade. They've made a world of difference in my daughter's screen time experience, providing relief from eye strain while looking fabulous at the same time.

### [Storm REZME Sleep Blue Light Gaming Glasses - Round Frame](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=storm-rezme-sleep-blue-light-gaming-glasses-round-frame)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/blue-light-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=blue-light-gaming-glasses&utm_term=storm-blue-light-glasses-sleeper-lens-bonfire-frames-1"><img alt="storm-blue-light-glasses-sleeper-lens-bonfire-frames-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/storm-blue-light-glasses-sleeper-lens-bonfire-frames-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The glasses are incredibly lightweight and comfortable, which is a huge plus when you're wearing them for hours on end.

Plus, the added anti-glare feature and 100% UV protection make playing games in dimmed rooms a breeze. As someone who struggles with eye strain and sleepless nights, the fact that these glasses have been clinically proven to improve sleep quality is a game-changer for me. 

However, there are a few cons to consider too. Some users have reported that the lens scratches easily, which could be an issue if you're not careful when cleaning them. Additionally, the etched logo on the right lens can create a glare when looking at certain screens, which may be distracting for some users. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the "Storm" blue light glasses to anyone who spends a significant amount of time in front of screens. While there are a few minor issues to consider, the benefits in terms of comfort, eye strain reduction, and sleep improvement make them a worthwhile investment.
