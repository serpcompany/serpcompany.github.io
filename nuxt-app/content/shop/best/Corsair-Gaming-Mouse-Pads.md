Another highlight is the non-slip base that keeps the pad securely in place, even when things get hectic during intense gameplay. However, I have to admit that the product does come with a slight trade-off, as the size can be a challenge for those with smaller workspaces. 

Overall, the CORSAIR MM350 PRO is a well-made, comfortable, and stylish mouse pad that delivers excellent performance. But if you're looking for portability, this might not be the best option for you. With a little research, you can decide if it's worth the investment in your gaming setup.

The clean black surface not only looks sleek, but it also offers the rigorous performance required by competitive gamers and eSports professionals. 

One of the standout features of this mouse pad is the 5mm plush rubber construction, which not only provides a comfortable wrist rest but also helps smooth out uneven surfaces on my desk.

Some users also reported that the non-slip base didn't always stick to their desks, causing the mouse pad to move around during use. 

Despite these minor issues, the Corsair Champion Series MM350 Medium Mouse Pad is an excellent accessory for any serious gamer looking for a comfortable, durable, and performance-enhancing addition to their setup.

Overall, the Razer Goliathus Extended Chroma is an excellent choice for gamers looking for a high-quality, well-built mouse pad with customizable lighting effects.

## FAQ

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/corsair-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=corsair-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=corsair-gaming-mouse-pads-4"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corsair+Gaming+Mouse+Pads-4/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Corsair Gaming Mouse Pads-4"></a></div>


### What is the difference between hard and soft gaming mouse pads?

Hard gaming mouse pads are made of rigid materials like plastic or aluminum, providing a smooth and consistent surface for high precision mouse movements. Soft gaming mouse pads, on the other hand, are made of fabric like cloth or neoprene, offering a slightly cushioned surface that's comfortable to use and can deaden noise from the mouse. Choosing between the two depends on personal preference, with hard pads generally favored by gamers who prioritize speed and precision, while soft pads may be more suitable for those who prefer comfort and noise reduction. 


### What is the significance of the size of a gaming mouse pad?

The size of a gaming mouse pad is important because it provides the optimal surface area for your mouse movements. Larger pads enable broader mouse strokes and allow for quick and efficient movement, especially during intense gaming sessions. However, the right size depends on your personal preferences and desk space. If you have limited room on your desk, a smaller mouse pad may be more suitable. But if you want the freedom to make large, expansive mouse movements, a larger pad would be more appropriate. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/corsair-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=corsair-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=corsair-gaming-mouse-pads-5"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corsair+Gaming+Mouse+Pads-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Corsair Gaming Mouse Pads-5"></a></div>


### How do I clean a gaming mouse pad?

The cleaning method varies depending on whether the mouse pad is hard or soft. For hard mouse pads, you can use a damp cloth or microfiber towel and a mild detergent to wipe down the surface. For more stubborn stains, a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol can be used. Soft gaming mouse pads should be cleaned more gently to prevent damage to the fabric. Use a damp cloth or soft brush with mild detergent to clean the surface, and then let it air dry to prevent mold or mildew. 


### Why do gaming mouse pads have RGB lighting?

Some gaming mouse pads have RGB lighting to add a customizable and visually appealing touch to your gaming setup. RGB lighting can be synced with other RGB components in your computer, such as keyboards and mice, to create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look. While this feature is more about personal preference and visual appeal, it can also add a level of immersion to your gameplay, with some games allowing you to synchronize the colors with in-game events or your team's color. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/corsair-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=corsair-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=corsair-gaming-mouse-pads-6"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Corsair+Gaming+Mouse+Pads-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Corsair Gaming Mouse Pads-6"></a></div>


### What is the difference between stitched and non-stitched edges on a gaming mouse pad?

Stitched edges on a gaming mouse pad are preferred for durability and comfort. When a mouse pad is stitched, the edges are sealed together with a thread, preventing the fabric from fraying or separating from the base material. This provides a clean and seamless look, as well as a level of comfort when using the mouse pad for extended periods. Non-stitched edges, on the other hand, may not be as durable and might start to fray or curl over time, affecting the feel and performance of the mouse pad during use. 


### How do Corsair Gaming Mouse Pads perform in terms of longevity and durability?

Corsair Gaming Mouse Pads are designed to be durable and long-lasting. The materials used in their construction, whether it's the hard plastic or the fabric on soft pads, are chosen for their resilience and ability to withstand regular use and wear. Additionally, the stitched edges on some models provide extra durability, preventing fraying or separation of the fabric from the base material. Regular cleaning and proper care will help maintain the longevity of your Corsair Gaming Mouse Pad.
