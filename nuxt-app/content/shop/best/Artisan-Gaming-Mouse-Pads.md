### [Glorious XXL Gaming Mouse Pad - Stealth](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=glorious-xxl-gaming-mouse-pad-stealth)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=glorious-xxl-extended-gaming-mouse-pad-stealth-edition-1"><img alt="glorious-xxl-extended-gaming-mouse-pad-stealth-edition-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-xxl-extended-gaming-mouse-pad-stealth-edition-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad - XXL Extended in Stealth. As an avid gamer, I was excited to try it out and see how it performs against my old mousepad. Man, let me tell you, it did not disappoint! 

The first thing I noticed about this extended mousepad is its size. It's gigantic! But in a good way. I replaced my old mousepad with this one, and now there is ample space for both my mechanical keyboard and my mouse to move freely without fear of running out of room. I also appreciate how it fits seamlessly under my keyboard, reducing noise and improving my typing experience. 

Another impressive feature is the smoothness of the surface. Glorious claims that their special surface provides a unique blend of speed and control, and they definitely deliver on that promise. The surface feels velvety soft but also offers just enough resistance to give me precise control when aiming. This makes it perfect for various game genres, from first-person shooters like Counter Strike to graphic design applications. 

But wait, there's more! One of the things I love most about this mousepad is its durability. The stitched edges prevent it from fraying or wearing down over time, which greatly increases its lifespan and aesthetic appeal. Plus, it's machine washable, so I can easily clean it without worrying about damaging it. 

However, like any product, there are some drawbacks. Some users have reported an unpleasant smell upon receiving their mousepad. While this wasn't a problem for me, I can see how it could be a deal-breaker for others. Additionally, some users have experienced issues with the mousepad losing its shape or becoming discolored quickly. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad - XXL Extended. Its large size, smooth surface, and durable construction make it an excellent choice for gamers and keyboard enthusiasts alike. While there may be minor issues like odor or discoloration, they don't detract from the overall quality of the product. If you're in the market for an extended gaming mousepad, I highly recommend giving this one a try! 


### [Large Hien Soft Mouse Pad for Comfortable Gaming](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=large-hien-soft-mouse-pad-for-comfortable-gaming)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-ninja-fx-hien-soft-l-wine-red-1"><img alt="artisan-ninja-fx-hien-soft-l-wine-red-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/artisan-ninja-fx-hien-soft-l-wine-red-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gamer, I am always on the lookout for products that not only enhance my gaming experience but also add a touch of style to my setup. The Artisan Ninja FX Hien Soft L Wine Red Mouse Pad did exactly that. From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell that this mouse pad was a cut above the rest. 

The first thing that struck me was its size. Measuring at 42mm x 33mm x 4mm, this mouse pad provided ample space for smooth mouse movements, enabling me to execute quick flicks and precise movements with ease. The knitted cloth surface felt incredibly comfortable under my palm, reducing fatigue during those long gaming sessions. 

What truly stood out was the middle layer. Constructed from 4mm single foamed foam of special structure, it offered the perfect balance of firmness and flexibility. This unique design allowed for optimal control and responsiveness, making it a dream come true for fast-paced games like first-person shooters. 

However, there were some minor drawbacks. The wine red color, while stylish, may not be everyone's cup of tea. Additionally, the softness of the surface might take some getting used to for those who prefer a harder surface. 

In conclusion, if you're looking to elevate your gaming setup with a high-quality mouse pad that delivers both comfort and performance, look no further than the Artisan Ninja FX Hien Soft L Wine Red. It's a game-changer in every sense of the word. 


### [Artisan Hien - Mid / XL Hardness Gaming Mouse Pad, Black](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-hien-mid-xl-hardness-gaming-mouse-pad-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-hien-ninja-fx-series-mid-xl-black-1"><img alt="artisan-hien-ninja-fx-series-mid-xl-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/artisan-hien-ninja-fx-series-mid-xl-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a die-hard gamer, I've tried countless mouse pads, but the Artisan Hien from Ninja FX Series truly stands out. This stylish black mat is not only sleek and elegant with its knitted cloth surface, but it's also incredibly effective. The medium-hard foam layer offers a perfectly balanced glide, making it the ideal surface for quick movements and precise aim without compromising on stability. 

However, it took me a while to get used to the significantly lower stopping power compared to other pads. But once I adjusted, there was no going back. Now, my hand-eye coordination has improved dramatically and my victory rate in online games has surged. 

The only downside is that the Artisan Hien may be quite pricey for some, but for me, it's worth every penny. This mouse pad has undoubtedly upped my game. 


### [Artisan Hayate Otsu - XSoft, XL, Black Gaming Mouse Pad](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-hayate-otsu-xsoft-xl-black-gaming-mouse-pad)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-hayate-otsu-ninja-fx-series-xsoft-xl-black-1"><img alt="artisan-hayate-otsu-ninja-fx-series-xsoft-xl-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/artisan-hayate-otsu-ninja-fx-series-xsoft-xl-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Once upon a time, I found myself in need of a reliable gaming mousepad. My old one was getting worn out, and I needed something that would provide a smooth, responsive surface for my rapid mouse movements. That's when I came across the Artisan Hayate Otsu - Ninja FX Series XSoft / XL / Black. 

Using this gaming mousepad has been an absolute game-changer (pun intended). It's a perfect size for my desk, and the material is like nothing I've ever experienced before. The soft, high-quality texture offers unparalleled precision, making it incredibly comfortable to use for long gaming sessions. 

However, it hasn't been all roses. The Artisan Hayate Otsu is on the pricier side, and I did have to wait a bit longer than I would have liked for it to arrive. But overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, making it a worthwhile investment for any serious gamer looking to up their game. 

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a top-notch gaming mousepad, the Artisan Hayate Otsu - Ninja FX Series XSoft / XL / Black is definitely worth considering. Its high-quality materials and exceptional performance make it a standout choice among the gaming community. 


### [Top-Notch Large Sized Gaming Mouse Pad by Xtrfy](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=top-notch-large-sized-gaming-mouse-pad-by-xtrfy)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=xtrfy-gp1-grayhound-tropical-large-surface-gaming-mouse-pad-cloth-surface-washable-460-x-400-x-4-mm-1"><img alt="xtrfy-gp1-grayhound-tropical-large-surface-gaming-mouse-pad-cloth-surface-washable-460-x-400-x-4-mm-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/xtrfy-gp1-grayhound-tropical-large-surface-gaming-mouse-pad-cloth-surface-washable-460-x-400-x-4-mm-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Xtrfy GP1 Tropical Gaming Mouse Pad for a few weeks now, and it's been a game-changer for my gaming experience. The large surface area provides ample room for quick, precise movements, while the high-speed cloth surface ensures smooth gliding and accurate tracking, whether I'm using a laser or optical mouse. 

One of the best things about this mousepad is its natural rubber base. It keeps the pad perfectly still during intense gaming sessions, so I don't have to worry about it sliding around on my desk. Plus, its washable design makes maintenance a breeze - just throw it in the laundry when it gets dirty! 

However, I have noticed that the material on the underside isn't as grippy as I would like it to be. Sometimes, I find myself having to reposition the mousepad more frequently than I would like. Despite this minor issue, the Xtrfy GP1 Tropical Gaming Mouse Pad has been an excellent addition to my gaming setup, and I would highly recommend it to others looking for a great gaming mousepad. 


### [Fast Glide Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad (Coffee Brown)](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=fast-glide-cloth-gaming-mouse-pad-coffee-brown)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-raiden-ninja-fx-series-mid-xl-coffee-brown-1"><img alt="artisan-raiden-ninja-fx-series-mid-xl-coffee-brown-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/artisan-raiden-ninja-fx-series-mid-xl-coffee-brown-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Oh man, I wanted to tell you about this awesome gaming mouse pad I've been using lately. It's part of the Raiden - Ninja FX Series and comes in three sizes: Mid, XL, and my personal favorite, Coffee Brown. 

This bad boy is made with a surface of super-dense knitted cloth, which gives it an incredibly smooth glide. You'd almost think it was made of ice, the way it moves so effortlessly. Makes gaming a lot more fun, especially with those games that require quick vertical moves. 

And oh boy, those fine threads! They make for a glide that's smoother than any fabric mouse pad I've ever used. Plus, it's got a nice solid middle layer of single-foamed foam. It's not too hard, not too soft - just the perfect "Mid" hardness for my taste. 

Now, let me tell you; this mouse pad is almost magically light. It's like it's floating on air when you move it. I've had no issues with it curling up or becoming uneven either, which is a big plus. 

There's a super cool rubber sole too, which really grips the mouse. No slipping and sliding around here. The sizes are spot-on too - I've got the XL one on my desk right now. 

However, on the downside, the color wasn't quite what I expected. It's more of a black than a dark brown. But hey, that's a small hiccup in an otherwise fantastic product. 

So, if you're looking for a super smooth, lightweight, and sizeable gaming mouse pad that offers excellent control, I'd say give the Artisan Raiden - Ninja FX Series in Coffee Brown a shot. You won't be disappointed! 


### [Artisan Hien - Wine Red Gaming Mouse Pad](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-hien-wine-red-gaming-mouse-pad)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-hien-ninja-fx-series-xsoft-l-wine-red-1"><img alt="artisan-hien-ninja-fx-series-xsoft-l-wine-red-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/artisan-hien-ninja-fx-series-xsoft-l-wine-red-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I was initially skeptical about investing in a high-end gaming mouse pad, but once I got my hands on the Artisan Hien - Ninja FX Series, all doubts were wiped away! This sleek, Wine Red pad boasts a knitted cloth surface made from polyester that offers a smooth, effortless glide for your mouse. The hardness of the XSOFT pad makes it incredibly comfortable to use, and it's perfectly sized for seamless movements. 

One feature that truly impresses me is the Hien FX technology, which enhances performance and precision, making it an essential tool for any serious gamer. Not to forget, the mesmerizing Wine Red color adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to my gaming setup. 

However, one downside to this otherwise amazing product is its size. As a medium size in Artisan's range, it may feel a bit small for some users who prefer a larger surface area for their mouse movements. Despite this minor inconvenience, I believe the Artisan Hien - Ninja FX Series is an excellent investment for any gamer looking to upgrade their setup and dominate the virtual battlefield. 


## Buyer's Guide


### Artisan Gaming Mouse Pads

Artisan mouse pads are a crucial accessory for gamers who demand precision, consistency, and comfort during extended gaming sessions. These high-quality pads provide excellent tracking capabilities and enhance your performance. When choosing an artisan gaming mouse pad, consider the following factors: 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads-2"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Artisan+Gaming+Mouse+Pads-2/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Artisan Gaming Mouse Pads-2"></a></div>


#### Material

The material of your gaming mouse pad plays a major role in its performance and longevity. High-quality artisan pads are usually made from materials such as cloth, aluminum, plastic, or glass. Each material offers unique benefits, such as surface uniformity, durability, and water resistance: 

* Cloth: Ideal for those who prefer a soft, comfortable surface. Cloth mouse pads are also affordable and easy to clean.

* Aluminum: Known for their rigidity and surface uniformity, aluminum mouse pads provide consistent tracking and are easy to clean.

* Plastic: Tough, lightweight, and water-resistant, plastic mouse pads offer great control and smooth gliding. They are often preferred by gamers who require rigidity and stability.

* Glass: Offers the smoothest gliding experience and exceptional control. Glass mouse pads are easy to clean and maintain, but can be heavy and breakable.


#### Size

Consider the size of your gaming desk and the amount of space you require for your mouse movements. Common sizes include small, medium, large, and extended. Make sure to choose a mouse pad that provides ample room for comfortable and efficient gameplay. 


#### Thickness

The thickness of your artisan mouse pad can affect the overall feel and comfort during extended gaming sessions. Thinner pads tend to provide a lower profile, allowing for smoother gliding and better control. Thicker pads provide extra cushioning and support for your wrists and hands, offering comfort during long gaming sessions. Choose a thickness that best suits your personal preference and playing style. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads-3"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Artisan+Gaming+Mouse+Pads-3/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Artisan Gaming Mouse Pads-3"></a></div>


#### Brand

Well-known brands often have a reputation for producing high-quality, reliable gaming products. Research the brand and read customer reviews to ensure you're purchasing a reliable and durable artisan gaming mouse pad. 


#### Price

Artisan gaming mouse pads can vary greatly in price, depending on materials, size, and quality. Determine your budget and look for a mouse pad that provides the best value for your money, considering factors like material, size, and brand reputation. 


#### Warranty

Look for a gaming mouse pad with a warranty or return policy. This way, you can be confident in your purchase and know that you have options if any issues arise with your product. 

By considering these factors, you can choose the perfect artisan gaming mouse pad to enhance your gaming experience and improve your performance.

## FAQ


### What is the difference between artisan gaming mouse pads and regular mouse pads?

Artisan gaming mouse pads are designed specifically for gamers, offering features like increased durability, advanced texture for better control, and lower friction for smoother mouse movement. Unlike regular mouse pads, artisan gaming mouse pads often prioritize performance over aesthetics, allowing gamers to improve their in-game performance. Additionally, they may come with special features like customizable sizes, built-in wrist rests, and RGB lighting. 


### How do I select the right size for my gaming mouse pad?

The right size depends on your personal preferences and desk setup. Some gamers prefer larger mouse pads that allow them to move the mouse freely without needing to lift it. Others opt for smaller pads that take up less desk space. Common sizes include standard (about 10x8 inches), extended (about 11x13 inches), and extra-large (about 15x12 inches to 20x48 inches). Consider your playstyle, mouse sensitivity, and desk space limitations when choosing the best size for your requirements. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads-5"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Artisan+Gaming+Mouse+Pads-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Artisan Gaming Mouse Pads-5"></a></div>


### What materials are used to make artisan gaming mouse pads?

Artisan gaming mouse pads can be made from various materials, but the most common ones are cloth, aluminum, and plastic. Cloth mouse pads offer a soft surface that provides excellent control and comfort, while aluminum pads provide a hard, smooth, and consistent surface. Plastic mouse pads, such as those made with polyethylene or polypropylene, offer a balance between control and speed. Each material has its own pros and cons, so choose the one that best suits your needs. 


### How do I clean and maintain my gaming mouse pad?

Cleaning and maintenance methods vary depending on the type of gaming mouse pad. For cloth mouse pads, gently wipe the surface with a damp cloth and mild detergent, followed by air drying. Avoid soaking the pad, as excessive moisture can damage it. For plastic and aluminum pads, a microfiber cloth or specialized cleaning solution can be used to keep the surface free from oils and debris. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the best cleaning methods for your specific mouse pad. 


### Which type of gaming mouse pad is best for accuracy and control?

Cloth gaming mouse pads are generally considered the best option for accuracy and control, as they provide more texture and friction compared to hard, smooth surfaces like aluminum or plastic. This increased friction allows for better control over the mouse's movements, making it easier to execute precise movements and maintain accuracy in-game. However, personal preference plays a significant role in determining the best type of mouse pad for your needs, so it's essential to try a variety of options before making a decision. 

<div><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/artisan-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads&utm_term=artisan-gaming-mouse-pads-6"><img src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/Artisan+Gaming+Mouse+Pads-6/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black" alt="Artisan Gaming Mouse Pads-6"></a></div>


### Can I use a standard office mouse on an artisan gaming mouse pad?

Yes, you can use a standard office mouse on an artisan gaming mouse pad. However, note that some gaming mouse pads, especially those designed for low-sensitivity gaming, may have a steeper angle and a higher level of friction. This might require some adjustments to your mouse settings or desk setup to ensure optimal performance and comfort. Additionally, using a gaming mouse with higher DPI (dots per inch) capabilities and adjustable weights is recommended for the best balance between speed and control. 


### What factors should I consider when choosing an artisan gaming mouse pad?

* Size: Consider your preferred size and the amount of desk space you have available.

* Material: Choose the material that best suits your playstyle, control preferences, and desk setup.

* Brand: Reputable brands often offer higher-quality products with better performance and durability.

* Features: Decide if you need additional features like customizable sizes, built-in wrist rests, or RGB lighting.


### How do I fix a curled or warped gaming mouse pad?

To fix a curled or warped gaming mouse pad, lay it on a flat surface with the affected area facing up. Use a heavy book or another object with a smooth, flat surface and place it on top of the mouse pad. Allow the mouse pad to flatten for several hours or overnight, or use a warm iron (on a low setting) to carefully apply heat and steam to the affected area, following the manufacturer's instructions for safe use. Once the mouse pad has flattened, allow it to cool completely before using it. Be sure not to apply too much heat or pressure, as this may damage the surface of the mouse pad.
