### [Geek Chic Square Prescription Glasses, Blokz Blue Light Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/zenni-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=zenni-gaming-glasses&utm_term=geek-chic-square-prescription-glasses-blokz-blue-light-glasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/zenni-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=zenni-gaming-glasses&utm_term=zenni-geek-chic-square-prescription-glasses-black-plastic-full-rim-frame-universal-bridge-fit-custom-1"><img alt="zenni-geek-chic-square-prescription-glasses-black-plastic-full-rim-frame-universal-bridge-fit-custom-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/zenni-geek-chic-square-prescription-glasses-black-plastic-full-rim-frame-universal-bridge-fit-custom-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on a pair of Zenni Geek Chic Square Prescription Glasses in black plastic full-rim frame, and boy, have they been a game-changer! The frame is not only stylish but also incredibly comfortable to wear. What I loved the most about these glasses is how they perfectly complement my outfits without becoming a distraction. 

One of the standout features for me was the universal bridge fit. No more adjusting my glasses every time I put them on or take them off! This is a feature that has made my life so much easier, especially when I'm in a hurry. 

Another great thing about these glasses is the custom engraving option. It allows me to personalize my glasses with my name or a special message, giving them that extra touch of uniqueness. 

On the flip side, the only con I found was the weight of the glasses. While the plastic frame feels sturdy and robust, it can get a bit heavy after wearing them for extended periods. However, this hasn't deterred me from using them as my go-to eyewear. 

All in all, the Zenni Geek Chic Square Prescription Glasses have been an excellent addition to my eyewear collection. They offer style, comfort, and convenience, making them an ideal choice for those who are looking for affordable and fashionable glasses. 


### [Zenni Blue Plastic Comfort Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/zenni-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=zenni-gaming-glasses&utm_term=zenni-blue-plastic-comfort-gaming-glasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/zenni-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=zenni-gaming-glasses&utm_term=zenni-rectangle-prescription-glasses-blue-plastic-full-rim-frame-universal-bridge-fit-custom-engravi-1"><img alt="zenni-rectangle-prescription-glasses-blue-plastic-full-rim-frame-universal-bridge-fit-custom-engravi-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/zenni-rectangle-prescription-glasses-blue-plastic-full-rim-frame-universal-bridge-fit-custom-engravi-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've always been a fan of practical solutions when it comes to eyewear, and these Zenni Rectangle Prescription Glasses definitely fit the bill. The blue plastic full-rim frame provides both a futuristic look and durability that's hard to beat. 

Despite being a little on the large side, they're surprisingly lightweight, thanks to the TR90 frame. The glossy finish and soft nose pads add a touch of elegance to an otherwise casual look. 

One feature that particularly stood out for me is the narrow temple arms, which secure the glasses firmly under a headset. This not only adds extra comfort, but it also helps maintain concentration during long gaming sessions. 

However, there was one slight downfall in my experience. The lens height could have been slightly greater for my taste, as it tends to be a bit distracting when engaged in racket sports. 

Overall, I won't lie - there are some minor cosmetic adjustments that could be made, like replacing the black rubber nose piece with a clear one. But, these Zenni Rectangle Prescription Glasses have served me well in various activities, from computer work to casual bike rides. They're a perfect combination of style, comfort, and functionality.

I've been using these Zenni gaming glasses in my daily life, and I must say, they've changed the game for me. The sporty rectangle design is made from lightweight TR90 plastic, which features sleek lines and colorful accents. I'm especially fond of the narrow temple arms that fit snugly under my headset, ensuring maximum comfort during those intense gaming sessions. With a prescription range of -20.00 to +12.00 and a full rim, these glasses provide excellent coverage for my eyes. 

One thing that truly impresses me is Zenni's commitment to quality and craftsmanship. They take their time to ensure that each and every pair of glasses is made with precision and care right here in the USA. The 135mm frame width, 54mm lens width, and 18mm bridge make these glasses perfect for my facial structure. 

While some users have mentioned issues with fit or durability, I haven't encountered any issues so far. The glasses have held up well during my intense gaming sessions, and the prescription lenses have been spot-on for my needs. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Zenni Men's Sporty Rectangle Prescription Glasses. They offer not only a stylish design but also excellent performance during gaming or daily use. Just be sure to double-check the measurements and sizing to ensure that you get the best possible fit.

The lens width and height are just right for my face shape, allowing for a perfect fit. Plus, the custom engraving option adds a personal touch that sets these glasses apart from other generic eyewear. 

Despite the many positives, there are a couple of minor drawbacks worth mentioning. First, the temple arms can be slightly difficult to adjust yourself, but a quick trip to your local optician can easily remedy this issue. Second, as with any plastic-framed glasses, they can be prone to light scratches over time. However, taking proper care and storing them in a protective case should mitigate this problem. 

In summary, Zenni Men's Rectangle Prescription Glasses are an excellent choice for those seeking a combination of style, comfort, and affordability. They're perfect for both indoor and outdoor activities, making them a versatile addition to your eyewear collection. Highly recommended for all eyeglass aficionados out there!

I recently purchased the Zenni Oval Prescription Glasses in black plastic full-rim frame with universal bridge fit and Blokz blue light glasses. With a -20.00 to +12.00 prescription range, it's perfect for those who need visual aid. The glasses feel lightweight, yet sturdy, due to their TR90 plastic construction, which also lends itself to a stylish glossy finish. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the snug fit. The narrow temple arms fit securely under my gaming headset, allowing for uninterrupted play. However, on the flip side, changing the arms can be quite a hassle as they tend to twist out constantly. This is definitely a con that needs to be addressed. 

Despite this minor inconvenience, I appreciate the clean lines and colorful accents of the glasses, making them both functional and fashionable. Overall, these glasses have been a decent addition to my daily routine, but the issue with changing arms has slightly dampened my enthusiasm. If Zenni can improve on this aspect, it would enhance the overall satisfaction rate of their customers.

As someone who has been wearing glasses for as long as I can remember, I was excited to try out these Zenni Men's Sporty Square Prescription Glasses. The first thing that caught my eye was the distinctive carbon fiber temple arms, which give these frames a stylish, modern look. Upon putting them on, I was pleasantly surprised by how lightweight and comfortable they were to wear. 

One issue I encountered was that the arms tend to fall off easily due to their unique screw design. Thankfully, this wasn't too much of a problem as I was able to secure them back in place with some super glue. Another minor inconvenience was that the frame size wasn't quite right for my face, causing them to slide down my nose slightly when I bent over. However, this issue can be solved by purchasing glasses with a smaller frame width or adjusting the arms accordingly. 

Overall, I'm quite happy with my purchase. The Zenni Men's Sporty Square Prescription Glasses not only look great but also provide clear vision and excellent durability. While there are some minor issues worth considering, I would recommend these glasses to anyone in need of stylish and functional eyewear.

I recently got my hands on the Zenni Geek Chic Rectangle Prescription Glasses in Black, and let me tell you, they're a game-changer! The black plastic frame adds a touch of classic style to my everyday look. What I love most about these glasses is their comfort. The medium size full-rim frame is lightweight and fits perfectly on my face. Plus, the Universal Bridge Fit ensures they stay snug even during my most intense gaming sessions. 

One of the standout features of these glasses is the Blokz Blue Light protection. After spending hours staring at screens, my eyes feel much less strained and fatigued. However, the coating on the lens can be a little distracting due to its rainbow tint that sometimes appears. It's not a deal-breaker, but it took some getting used to. 

Another minor inconvenience is the placement of the lens screws. While they don't hinder my vision, they can be slightly annoying as they're prominently visible within our field of vision.

As a writer, I often find myself in front of screens more than I should. But I discovered these Zenni Geek Chic Rectangle Prescription Glasses, and they've made a huge difference! The first time I wore them, I could immediately feel the relief they provided. The sturdy plastic frame comes in a blue hue that's subtle yet attractive, and the glasses are designed for extended wear, making them perfect for days spent working on the computer. 

One of the things that impress me most about these glasses is their ability to block blue light. I can wear them all day and not feel the strain on my eyes that I used to experience. Plus, they're lightweight and comfortable, which means I can forget I'm wearing them. 

However, one issue I've noticed is that the frame size seems a bit small. I have a relatively large head, and these glasses are a bit too snug for my liking. Another thing to note is that the lens quality could be better. However, considering the affordable price point, these glasses are an excellent choice for anyone looking for stylish, comfortable eyewear. 

Overall, I'm very satisfied with my Zenni Geek Chic Rectangle Prescription Glasses. They've made a significant difference in my daily life, and I won't go back to my old glasses. If you're in the market for a new pair of glasses, I highly recommend giving Zenni a try.

Well, I've been using these ZenniRectanglePrescriptionGlasses / Goggles with a Strap for a few weeks now, and boy, they really do the trick. They are designed keeping sports like basketball, soccer, badminton, and handball in mind. So, whether I'm playing volleyball or badminton, these glasses provide excellent protection for my eyes. 

One thing I really appreciated is the comfortable fit. They come with non-slip rubber cushioning on the bridge and temples, which adds a nice touch to overall comfort. Plus, the built-in adjustable strap has been a game changer. I remember how my previous glasses used to slip off my face when I was active, but not with these ones! 

One of the best things about these glasses is their impact-resistant lens package. These lenses are made from polycarbonate and Trivex materials that are not only strong but also lightweight. They also offer 100% UV protection, anti-scratch coating, and a super hydrophobic anti-reflective coating. For those who are prone to sweat while playing, like me, these features make sure my vision remains clear and sharp. 

However, there's one downside that I noticed. The lenses have a slight distortion at the edges, especially when looking at the sides, which can be a little distracting. But it's not a deal-breaker, at least not for me. 

All in all, these ZenniRectanglePrescriptionGlasses / Goggles have been a lifesaver for my sports activities. They're comfortable, secure, and provide excellent protection for my eyes. If you're looking for sports glasses that won't break the bank, these are definitely worth considering.

I've been using these Zenni Men's Rectangle Prescription Glasses for about a month now, and I have to say, they've become a staple in my daily wardrobe. The sleek black plastic frame complements any outfit. The glasses are incredibly lightweight and comfortable to wear all day, so I won't have to worry about any pesky headaches. I was initially nervous about ordering glasses online, but these are spot on with my prescription - no headaches from squinting or strain from incorrect lenses. 

Not only do they look good, but they also have a subtle green color on the sides that adds a nice touch of uniqueness. The temple arms fit perfectly under my gaming headset, making it easier to stay focused without constantly fumbling to adjust my glasses. Plus, the lenses are designed to block out blue light from screens, reducing eye strain. 

However, there are a few aspects that could be improved. The hinges seem a bit loose, and I've had to tighten them every few days. Additionally, some of the green accents on the frame are starting to peel off, which gives off an unpolished look. But despite these minor issues, I believe these glasses are well worth the purchase.

I've been wearing Zenni Men's Rectangle Prescription Glasses with a black carbon fiber frame for the past few weeks, and I must say they've become my go-to pair. The medium-wide frame is stylish and modern, with a metal half-rim front that complements my features perfectly.

One of the things that stood out for me is the quality of the glasses. The carbon fiber temple arms add a sleek touch, and the satin finish gives them a sophisticated look. Plus, the glasses effectively block blue light, which is essential for those of us who spend hours staring at screens. 

However, one issue I faced was the lack of spring hinges in the glasses. While the hinges do work, they feel slightly flimsy compared to my previous pairs of glasses. Additionally, I noticed a small imperfection on one of the carbon fiber arms. Overall, these glasses are stylish and comfortable, but there is room for improvement in the build quality and durability department. 

In conclusion, I would recommend Zenni Men's Rectangle Prescription Glasses to anyone in search of a well-made, affordable pair of glasses with a modern, sophisticated look. Just keep in mind that they may not be the strongest out there, so consider using them in addition to a more robust pair of frames for demanding environments.

My Zenni gaming glasses have been a game-changer for me. As an avid gamer, I've struggled with traditional glasses sliding off my face while wearing a headset. However, this pair has a specially designed temple arm that comfortably fits underneath my headset, keeping them secure and in place. 

Not only do these glasses offer improved comfort during long gaming sessions, but their stylish round frames also provide a vintage edge. I truly appreciate the attention to detail in crafting these glasses - from the perfect placement of the lens to the ideal balance of the frame on my face. 

One thing I've noticed is the flexibility of the frames. While it does allow for some adjustments, there have been times when I wish the frame and temple arm were slightly sturdier to fully align with my headset. Also, on a personal note, I find the arms to be a bit too long for my preference, which causes them to slip forward occasionally. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I highly recommend the Zenni Round Prescription Glasses Black Mixed Full Rim Frame. They've truly elevated my gaming experience and added a touch of style to my daily life as well.

As a glasses enthusiast, I've tried my fair share of eyewear, but these Zenni Rectangle glasses truly stand out. From the moment I put them on, I could feel the perfect balance of comfort and style. The light and flexible TR90 plastic frame is made for my smaller face, so there's no unnecessary pressure on my ears or bridge of my nose. Plus, the variety of color options available allowed me to pick one that perfectly matches my daily outfits.

These glasses are much more cost-effective than those I would typically find at an optician's office. 

However, there was one issue I encountered - the anti-reflective coating on a pair of glasses I ordered started to chip off within just a few months. Despite this, I still highly recommend these Zenni Prescription glasses for their style, comfort, and affordability. Whether you're an adult or a college student, they will surely enhance your daily life.
