### [L-Shape Reversible Corner Computer Desk for Home Office Large Gaming Workstation](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-desks-with-storage?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gaming-desks-with-storage&utm_term=l-shape-reversible-corner-computer-desk-for-home-office-large-gaming-workstation)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gaming-desks-with-storage?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gaming-desks-with-storage&utm_term=bestier-desk-with-shelves-86-inch-reversible-corner-computer-desk-or-2-person-long-table-for-home-of-1"><img alt="bestier-desk-with-shelves-86-inch-reversible-corner-computer-desk-or-2-person-long-table-for-home-of-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bestier-desk-with-shelves-86-inch-reversible-corner-computer-desk-or-2-person-long-table-for-home-of-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Nestled in the corner of my home office, the Bestier desk has become an integral part of my daily routine. As a writer, I need a spacious workstation and the 86-inch long table provides just that. I particularly appreciate the adjustable L-shape that gives me the flexibility to either place it in the corner or have two separate desks side by side. The durable metal frame and the high-quality P2 class wood promise longevity, making it an excellent long-term investment. 

One of the standout features of this desk is its effective cable management system. With three holes strategically placed on the table, I can keep my wires organized and out of sight, giving my workspace a clean and clutter-free look. However, the assembly process can be a bit overwhelming due to the large number of small parts involved. I had to dedicate a significant amount of time to carefully study the instructions and ensure that I followed each step accurately. 

In terms of ease of assembly, I found the diagrams to be clear and comprehensive. However, locating the holes on the metal frame supports was a challenge, as they were not clearly marked. Once I overcame this hurdle, assembling the rest of the desk was relatively straightforward. Despite the heaviness of the table, I managed to put it together myself, although having an extra pair of hands might have made the process faster. 

Another notable feature of the Bestier desk is the storage shelves, which help keep my office essentials organized and easily accessible. The sturdy structure provides ample support, preventing any sagging or instability, even when I place multiple items on the shelves. 

In conclusion, the Bestier desk has proven to be an excellent addition to my home office. Its adjustable design, durable materials, and efficient cable management system make it a desirable choice for anyone seeking a reliable and well-functioning workspace. However, be prepared for a time-consuming assembly process and the need to handle a large number of small components.

I recently got my hands on this L-shaped gaming desk with LED lights and power outlets, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in my gaming zone! The built-in charging station with multiple outlets and USB ports has helped me keep my devices and gaming gear fully charged at all times. The LED lights are an absolute delight, giving my space a cool and immersive ambience with their unlimited color options and adjustable brightness. 

One thing that impressed me the most is the spacious desktop that offers ample room for multiple monitors and other gaming peripherals. The monitor stand helps keep my setup organized and clutter-free. Plus, the cup holder and headphone hook are such thoughtful additions that keep my essentials within easy reach. 

In terms of space-saving, this desk is perfect for any room type as it forms a "U" shaped workstation when combined with another L-shaped desk. Its sturdy X-shaped leg design and adjustable leg pads ensure a rock-solid setup, even on uneven surfaces. 

However, my only concern with this desk is that it took longer than expected to assemble. Nonetheless, the final result was worth the effort, and I'm thoroughly enjoying my new spacious gaming setup!

I recently got my hands on the Bestier LED Gaming Computer Desk, and I must say, it's got more than just a few tricks up its sleeve. For starters, its 61" width provides ample space for all my essentials, whether it's work stuff or my beloved gaming gear. Besides, the LED lights incorporated in it are no joke! They instantly add a fun element to your space, making late-night work sessions or intense gaming sessions feel less mundane. 

One thing I absolutely loved about this desk is how organized it is. With the hooks and multiple storage shelves, I can have all my items - from headphones to books to even snacks - within easy reach. Plus, the side bag comes real handy for storing my smaller essentials like pens and notepads. 

However, speaking of cons, I did face some issues with the packaging. Some parts arrived damaged, which was quite a bummer. Not to mention, the brown strip on the bag attached to the desk doesn't perfectly match the black theme, making it look slightly off. 

All in all, I'm quite happy with the Bestier LED Gaming Computer Desk. It's stylish, functional, and has made my work and gaming experiences more enjoyable. Just be prepared for some possible damage while shipping and mind the minor design flaw with the bag.

I recently got a chance to test out the Bestier Gaming Desk with Monitor Shelf and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my small space office setup! The desk is not only stylish but also incredibly functional. I particularly love the raised monitor shelf which not only gives me more room for office accessories but also ensures a comfortable viewing angle while sitting at the desk. 

The adjustable shelves under the computer desk are another great feature. They can be moved to different heights according to your needs, making it perfect for storing various items like a CPU tower, printer, books, and more. And don't worry about running out of space - this desk is spacious enough to accommodate multiple monitors, keyboards, calculators, phones, and more. 

As for the build, this desk is sturdy and well-constructed using metal frames and P2 wood board. The X crossbar adds extra stability, making sure your setup stays secure even during intense gaming sessions. Plus, assembly was a breeze. All necessary tools and instructions are included, making it easy for anyone to set up the desk in no time. 

However, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the desk does not come with built-in cable management, so you'll need to handle that part yourself. Additionally, while the desk is sturdy, a few users have reported receiving damaged or chipped parts upon delivery. 

Overall, the Bestier Gaming Desk with Monitor Shelf offers a perfect blend of style, functionality, and ease of assembly. If you're looking for a compact, stylish, and highly adjustable desk for your home office or gaming setup, this could be the perfect choice for you! Just remember to handle cable management on your own and inspect the package for any potential damages upon delivery.

One of the best features is the monitor stand that raises my display, improving my posture while working. The spacious storage drawers and file cabinet, complete with a lock, keep all my essentials organized and secure. And let's not forget the convenient spot for my printer and books! 

However, one downside I found is the weight of this desk—at 99 pounds, it's not easy to move around. But overall, I'm really happy with how it has enhanced my productivity and efficiency. If you're looking for a stylish, functional, and practical desk for your home or office, I would highly recommend this one.
