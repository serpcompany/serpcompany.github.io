I've been using the Razer Naga V2 HyperSpeed for a few months now and let me tell you, it's been quite the adventure. As an avid gamer, I was excited to try out this wireless ergonomic MMO mouse with its 19 buttons and dual-mode scroll wheel. I have to start by mentioning its impressively long battery life - it can last up to 400 hours on HyperSpeed Wireless! 

This mouse has truly transformed my gameplay experience. The side buttons are incredibly responsive, allowing me to execute skill rotations with ease and speed during intense raids. The build quality is impressive; it feels solid in my hand without being too heavy. Setting up was a breeze, even for someone who isn't tech-savvy. 

Now, onto the cons. The software took some time figuring out, but after getting some guidance from Razer support, I was able to customize and save my macros smoothly. Additionally, while the battery life is excellent, the fact that it doesn't come with a rechargeable option might be a bummer for some users. 

In summary, the Razer Naga V2 HyperSpeed has not only met but exceeded my expectations as an MMO gamer.

### How do I choose the right gaming mouse with side buttons for my needs?

Choosing the right gaming mouse with side buttons depends on various factors, such as your budget, hand size, personal preferences, and the types of games you play. Consider the number of side buttons, sensor type, ergonomics, cable vs. wireless, software customization options, and overall build quality when making your decision. 


### What is the difference between optical and laser sensors in gaming mice with side buttons?

Optical sensors use LED light to track mouse movements, while laser sensors use an infrared laser for the same purpose. Optical sensors are generally considered more reliable, offering consistent performance and less risk of in-game lag. Laser sensors, on the other hand, tend to have higher DPI (dots per inch) options and can work on more surfaces, including glass, which could make them more suitable for some gaming scenarios.
