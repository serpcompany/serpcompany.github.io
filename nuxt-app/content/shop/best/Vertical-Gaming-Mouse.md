### [Finalmouse Starlight-12 Phantom Wireless Mouse (Small)](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/vertical-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=vertical-gaming-mouse&utm_term=finalmouse-starlight-12-phantom-wireless-mouse-small)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/vertical-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=vertical-gaming-mouse&utm_term=finalmouse-starlight-12-phantom-wireless-mouse-small-1"><img alt="finalmouse-starlight-12-phantom-wireless-mouse-small-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/finalmouse-starlight-12-phantom-wireless-mouse-small-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the Finalmouse Starlight-12 Phantom Wireless Mouse (Small) for quite some time now, and I must say, it's truly a game-changer. The magnesium alloy shell with a honeycomb pattern not only looks sleek but also keeps the mouse incredibly light at just 43 grams. Its unconventional design has taken some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you won’t want to go back to your old mouse. 

One of the standout features of this mouse is its Jauch Lithium Ion rechargeable battery that lasts approximately 160 hours. Combined with the Finalsensor, which offers a resolution (CPI) of up to 20,000, very low lift-off distance, and 4 CPI pre-sets, this mouse is perfect for gaming, office work, and multi-media usage. 

There are a few downsides though. The smaller size might not suit everyone, especially those with larger hands. Moreover, with no left-click or right-click buttons, it might take a considerable amount of time for some to get accustomed. Lastly, some users reported an issue with the scroll wheel, which can be a bit wonky at times. 

Overall, the Finalmouse Starlight-12 Phantom Wireless Mouse (Small) is a high-quality device perfect for anyone seeking an innovative, lightweight, and responsive mouse for their day-to-day needs. However, its unique design and lack of physical buttons might not be everyone’s cup of tea.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/vertical-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=vertical-gaming-mouse&utm_term=perixx-wired-mouse-ergo-perimice-513-vertical-1"><img alt="perixx-wired-mouse-ergo-perimice-513-vertical-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/perixx-wired-mouse-ergo-perimice-513-vertical-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Perixx Wired Mouse Ergo, and I've been using it daily for all my computer needs. As someone who spent hours sitting in front of my computer, I was excited to try this ergonomic mouse out. 

The first thing that stood out to me was the vertical design. Unlike traditional mice, it aligns with the natural position of my hand and wrist muscles. This allowed me to navigate through my work without straining my wrist. It's perfect for long office hours, gaming sessions, or extended browsing on the internet, making it a versatile choice. 

But what truly impressed me was its ergonomic natural vertical for left-handed use. As a left-hander, I often feel left out when it comes to picking out gadgets. So, this was a pleasant surprise! It's recommended for anyone suffering from musculoskeletal disorders or those who work extensively on their computers. 

In terms of usability, I found it incredibly easy to use. The buttons are conveniently located, giving me quick access to multiple functions. Plus, the DPI switch provides two sensitivity levels - 1000/1600 dpi, which can be adjusted according to your preference. 

However, there are a few minor cons to consider. Firstly, the glossy buttons feel slightly cheaper compared to the high-quality rubber coating surface. Additionally, the sound made by the microswitches can be quite loud. Lastly, I wish there were more buttons to enhance customization options. 

In conclusion, the Perixx Wired Mouse Ergo has enhanced my daily computer interactions. Its vertical design promotes healthy hand posture, reducing strain and discomfort during prolonged use. Despite minor drawbacks, it's an excellent investment for anyone seeking relief from hand fatigue or looking to upgrade their mouse.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/vertical-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=vertical-gaming-mouse&utm_term=logitech-mx-vertical-ergonomic-wireless-mouse-1"><img alt="logitech-mx-vertical-ergonomic-wireless-mouse-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/logitech-mx-vertical-ergonomic-wireless-mouse-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I received the Logitech MX Vertical Ergonomic Wireless Mouse recently, and I have to say, it's been quite the experience. From the moment I took it out of the box, the first thing that struck me was the unique design – it looks like a regular mouse but stands vertically! 

The concept is simple - to reduce muscle strain and wrist pressure, which are common issues for people who spend a lot of time on their computers. Now, after using it for about a week, I can attest to its effectiveness. My wrist has been much less fatigued than before when using a traditional mouse. 

Setting up the mouse was a breeze. You can connect it to your computer via USB-C cable or wirelessly using the Unifying USB receiver or Bluetooth. The wireless connectivity has a good range of 10 meters, and despite being a bit old-school, the USB-C charging has been incredibly convenient. A full charge lasts for up to four months, and even a quick one-minute charge gives you enough juice for three hours of usage. 

One thing I appreciated was the customizable buttons - you can configure them through the Logitech options software for your specific needs. The optical sensor technology works great on both Windows and Mac, making this mouse universally compatible. 

There are some minor drawbacks though. The mouse doesn't have a built-in button for adjusting the DPI. Also, not all USB ports on some computers might power the receiver properly, leading to occasional disconnections. 

Overall, the Logitech MX Vertical has lived up to its promise of being an ergonomic solution for those long hours at the computer. The unique design, customizable buttons, and strong connectivity make this mouse a great addition to any workspace. So, if you're tired of sore wrists from typing and mousing all day, I'd wholeheartedly recommend giving this mouse a shot.

As a product reviewer who's been using the Anker 2.4g Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Optical Mouse, I can attest to its unique design and comfort. The vertical "handshake" position is a game-changer for those prone to wrist strain, with its ability to encourage a neutral wrist and arm alignment. Easy-to-reach buttons and decent size make it an enjoyable experience. However, there are some cons to consider. 

Firstly, the placement of buttons may feel awkward for some users, especially those with larger hands. Additionally, the lack of Bluetooth connectivity might be a downside for those who prefer the convenience of seamless device switching. Lastly, the choice to omit rechargeable batteries, despite Anker's excellent reputation in the power accessory market, may leave some users questioning this decision. 

Overall, the Anker Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Mouse offers a comfortable and unique design, perfect for those looking to reduce wrist strain during their daily computer use. While there may be some shortcomings in terms of button placement and connectivity, it is still a solid choice for users seeking an ergonomic mouse solution.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/vertical-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=vertical-gaming-mouse&utm_term=logitech-mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-1"><img alt="logitech-mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/logitech-mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Logitech MX Vertical Ergonomic Mouse, and let me tell you, it has been a game-changer for my wrist comfort. As someone who spends countless hours on my computer, I've always struggled with wrist strain and discomfort. 

The MX Vertical truly stands out with its unique 57-degree vertical angle. This design has significantly reduced the strain on my wrist compared to traditional mice. The thumb rest is also an excellent addition, providing further support and comfort. Its user-tested and ergonomist-approved features make it a trustworthy choice for those looking to improve their wrist posture. 

One of the standout performance aspects of the MX Vertical is its advanced optical tracking combined with the cursor speed switch. This feature allows me to easily switch between scrolling and precise cursor movements, making it versatile for various tasks. 

However, I must admit there were a few cons that surprised me. The lack of USB port compatibility with older devices left me disappointed, as I had hoped they would be fully compatible. Additionally, some users reported issues with the scroll wheel not functioning properly on their Mac computers. 

Overall, I am extremely happy with the performance and design of the Logitech MX Vertical Ergonomic Mouse. Its innovative features and focus on wrist comfort make it a must-have accessory for anyone who spends hours in front of their computer. While it does have its drawbacks, the benefits far outweigh the negatives, making the MX Vertical an excellent ergonomic gaming mouse for daily use. 


### [Lift Wireless Vertical Ergonomic Mouse for Comfort](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/vertical-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=vertical-gaming-mouse&utm_term=lift-wireless-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-for-comfort)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/vertical-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=vertical-gaming-mouse&utm_term=logitech-lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-off-white-1"><img alt="logitech-lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-off-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/logitech-lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse-off-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I sit at my work desk, day after day, the strain on my wrists and arms from using a standard mouse was becoming unbearable. That's when I decided to give the Logitech Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse a try, and I'm so glad I did. 

Right out of the box, it was evident that this wasn't your average mouse. The unique 57-degree angle immediately caught my eye, and after using it for a few days, I can confirm that it truly is a game-changer. The vertical shape elevates my wrist in a way that just feels so much more natural and comfortable than any other mouse I've ever used. 

One of the standout features for me is the SmartWheel. When I need to scroll through long documents or web pages, having the ability to easily switch between precision scrolling and high-speed scrolling is a absolute lifesaver. And let's not forget about the customizable buttons! With Logi Options+ Software, it's incredibly easy to tailor this mouse to my own personal preferences and work style. 

However, no product is perfect, and the Logitech Lift does have a few minor drawbacks. For starters, the fact that it requires an AA battery can be a bit inconvenient at times, though not a deal-breaker by any means. Additionally, I wish the grip area for my thumb were a little larger, as it can sometimes feel a tad cramped during extended use. 

Overall, I've been incredibly happy with the Logitech Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse. It's made a world of difference for my wrist and arm comfort, and I'm confident that you'll be equally impressed if you decide to give it a try.

It can be paired with three devices at once, which means I can use it with my trusty Mac, my work laptop, and even my iPad with a tap of a button. Plus, its security features make it feel like Fort Knox for my digital world. 

However, I have to admit that the Lift Vertical Ergonomic Mouse has taken some time to get used to. The button placements and gestures are different from what I'm accustomed to, and it took a few days for my hand to adjust to the new angle. But once I got the hang of it, there was no going back!

Its unique design and precision make it stand out from the crowd, and its security features make it perfect for those in the business world. So why not give it a try?

Another standout feature is its ability to connect up to three devices simultaneously via Bluetooth or Logi Bolt. This has been incredibly useful in smoothly transitioning between my laptop, tablet, and computer without any hiccups. Plus, the battery life on this mouse is impressive, lasting up to two years from a single AA battery.

As a content creator and software engineer, I've tried a variety of ergonomic mice to prevent hand strain and RSI. My favorite, by far, has been the refurbished Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse. 

The first thing you'll notice about this mouse is its unique vertical design. It may feel a tad unconventional at first, but once you get used to it, you'll wonder how you ever functioned with a regular mouse. The vertical orientation provides a more natural handshake grip that reduces strain on your wrist and forearm, making it incredibly comfortable for extended periods of use. 

I also love the customizable buttons and the smooth scroll wheel. These features allow me to navigate through my work seamlessly, making me more productive than ever before. And did I mention the battery life? I can go weeks without needing to recharge this bad boy, which is a major bonus. 

However, there is one downside worth mentioning. I've encountered some issues with compatibility on macOS. Sometimes, the mouse just stops working abruptly, requiring me to restart my computer or reinstall the software to get it up and running again. It's a minor inconvenience, but it has led to some frustrating moments. 

In conclusion, the Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse is the perfect companion for those seeking ergonomic relief without sacrificing performance. While there are some minor drawbacks, its comfortable design, customizable buttons, and impressive battery life make it well worth the investment.

The buttons are well-positioned, especially the forward-back button, which is a breeze to use while browsing the web. 

The surface of the mouse is smooth and skin-friendly, making it comfortable to hold for extended periods. Additionally, the detachable stock allows for flexibility in personalizing its appearance based on your preference. The optical tracking system offers precision and responsiveness, while the adjustable sensitivity (1000/1600/2400 dpi) ensures an optimal experience tailored to your needs. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to note. The mouse requires a USB port, which may be an issue for some users, especially those with limited ports on their computers. Additionally, the USB receiver is tucked away in the battery slot, which could be frustrating to locate initially. Lastly, a AA battery is required, but it is not included in the package. 

Despite these cons, the overall experience with this vertical gaming mouse has been positive, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and efficient way to navigate their computer.
