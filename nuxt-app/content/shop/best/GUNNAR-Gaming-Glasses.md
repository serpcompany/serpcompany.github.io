### [GUNNAR Intercept - Premium Gaming Eyewear](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-intercept-premium-gaming-eyewear)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1"><img alt="gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out GUNNAR's Intercept gaming glasses in onyx. As a gamer myself, I was excited to see how these glasses would impact my overall gaming experience. The first thing that struck me about the Intercepts was their sleek design. Not only do they look great, but they're also incredibly comfortable. The lightweight frame and curved nose rests ensure that they sit perfectly on my face, without causing any discomfort. 

One of the standout features of these glasses is their patented lens technology. It's designed to limit air currents near the eyes, preventing irritation and reducing eye strain. I've spent countless hours gaming with the Intercepts on, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my focus and visual clarity. The high-index lens material eliminates distortion from impurities and haze, ensuring that everything I see on screen is crystal clear. 

Another feature that I really appreciate is the lens tint. It filters blue light and blocks UV, which not only enhances contrast but also protects my eyes from harmful rays. Additionally, the lens coatings reduce glare and reflective light, helping to eliminate visual distractions and stress. 

However, I did encounter a few minor issues with the Intercepts. Firstly, the lenses tend to reflect light in certain lighting conditions, which can be a bit distracting at times. Secondly, the shape of the glasses may not be to everyone's taste, as they have a more masculine design. Finally, while the glasses are comfortable, they can become slightly uncomfortable when worn with larger headphones. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the GUNNAR Intercept gaming glasses to anyone looking to enhance their gaming experience and reduce eye strain. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. So if you're in the market for a new pair of gaming glasses, be sure to give the Intercepts a try!

Introducing the Gaming Glasses - Lightning Bolt 360, a stylish and functional solution for long hours of gaming. Coming in a classic onyx frame, this pair of glasses not only enhances your gaming experience but also helps you maintain optimal eye health.

The glasses are UV-protected, blocking up to 65% of blue light emissions from computer monitors, tablets, phones, and other digital devices. This helps in reducing eyestrain and dryness, making it perfect for both work and play. 

An included sunlight lens provides 100% protection against UV rays, making these glasses suitable for outdoor use as well. A protective case and pouch ensure safe storage when not in use. 

However, these glasses are not prescription-based, which can be a limitation for some users. Also, the amber lenses may take a little getting used to due to their slightly yellowish tinge but it does help in enhancing screen visibility and reduces glare. 

In conclusion, if you're a serious gamer looking for a stylish pair of glasses that are both comfortable and functional, the Gaming Glasses - Lightning Bolt 360 is worth considering.

But what really sets these glasses apart from other gaming glasses is their ability to reduce glare and enhance color contrast on your screen. The blue light filter in the lenses helps reduce eye strain and fatigue, while the amber tint helps refine details and improve visual acuity. This difference was noticeable right away, as I found myself spotting enemies and objects more easily in fast-paced FPS games. 

One downside to these glasses is that they don't look as stylish as some other models on the market. However, if you're someone who prioritizes functionality over looks, then the Gunnar Razer FPS Gaming Glasses won't disappoint. Overall, I would highly recommend giving these glasses a try if you're a dedicated gamer who spends a lot of time in front of a screen. They've made my gaming sessions more comfortable and enjoyable, and I believe they can do the same for you.

However, one downside to these glasses is their price. At $79.99, they are on the expensive side compared to other gaming accessories. Additionally, the thin frame design may not be to everyone's taste, especially if you prefer a bolder or more unique look. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Gunnar FPS Razer Edition gaming glasses to anyone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer screen. They may not be perfect, but they have greatly improved my gaming experience and helped alleviate some of the long-term effects of extended screen time.

I recently got the chance to try out a pair of Intercept gaming glasses by Gunnar. As someone who spends a lot of time staring at screens, these glasses have become an essential part of my daily wear. The first thing that drew me in was the sleek design, as the classic frame complements the modern technology, giving it a unique, retro feel. 

One of the main reasons I chose these glasses is the amber lenses, which are designed to block up to 65% of blue light transmission and offer 100% UV protection. After using them for a few weeks, I can definitely say that they have made a difference in my comfort while using screens for extended periods. I noticed that the blue light-blocking feature helps to reduce eye strain and fatigue, making it easier for me to wind down at night without disturbing my sleeping patterns. 

Another aspect that I appreciate is the anti-microbial nature of the frame material. This allows me to wear the glasses for long hours without worrying about hygiene or comfort issues. Additionally, the ergonomic balance of the frame ensures that it stays securely on my face, even when I'm moving around or leaning in to focus on something on the screen. 

However, there have been a few minor downsides. For example, the lens material seems to cause a slight glare due to its reflective nature, which can be slightly distracting. Moreover, the size of the glasses may not suit everyone, as they are designed with a particular frame width and bridge width in mind. 

In conclusion, the Intercept gaming glasses by Gunnar offer a stylish and functional solution for reducing eye strain caused by prolonged screen use. The blue light-blocking lenses and anti-microbial material have made a significant difference in my daily comfort. Though there are a few minor drawbacks, this is definitely a product worth considering if you are in the market for gaming or computer glasses.

I have been using the Gunnar Cruz Computer Glasses for a few weeks now, and I have to say, they're a game-changer. The onyx frame with amber lenses not only looks fashionable, but it also provides excellent UV protection, keeping my eyes safe from harmful sunrays. 

One of the standout features of these glasses is the nylon material. It makes the frames durable and comfortable to wear for extended periods, perfect for those long gaming sessions. The curved nose rest is an added bonus, making sure the glasses sit evenly on my face and reducing any stress or strain on my nose. 

As someone who spends hours on end in front of screens, I have experienced firsthand the benefits of these glasses. Not only do they help reduce eye strain and fatigue caused by blue light emissions, but they also help me stay focused and comfortable during those marathon gaming sessions. 

The only downside I can think of is the fact that they're designed with a narrow frame, which might not be the best fit for everyone. However, for someone like me who has a narrow face, they're the perfect addition to my gaming setup. 

Overall, I highly recommend the Gunnar Cruz Computer Glasses to anyone looking for a stylish and effective way to protect their eyes from the harmful effects of extended screen time. They've become an essential part of my daily routine, and I can't imagine going back to life without them.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-optiks-att-00101-attache-gaming-computer-glasses-onyx-amber-1"><img alt="gunnar-optiks-att-00101-attache-gaming-computer-glasses-onyx-amber-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-optiks-att-00101-attache-gaming-computer-glasses-onyx-amber-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As an avid gamer, I've always been concerned about the long-term effects of prolonged screen time on my eyes. I had heard great things about the Gunnar Optiks ATT-00101 Attache Gaming Computer Glasses and finally decided to give them a try. 

Right off the bat, I appreciated how comfortable these glasses are. The lightweight design fits my face perfectly, reducing eye strain and making it easier for me to focus on my game. However, one downside is that they do reflect the blue light of the screen back on the lenses when I'm on a Zoom call, giving me blue robot eyes. While it might not be noticeable to others, it's something I've become conscious of since using these glasses. 

Another highlight of the Attache glasses is their ability to filter harmful blue light. These glasses are equipped to block 65% of harmful blue light and 100% of UV rays, which has significantly reduced my eye strain and helped me get a better night's sleep. I have noticed that my eyes feel less heavy at the end of my 8+ hour gaming sessions. 

The only issue I've come across with these glasses is that the lenses seem to get dirty and marked up quite easily. I find myself constantly having to clean them so I can see clearly while gaming. Overall, I am quite pleased with the quality of these glasses and how relaxed they make my eyes feel. 

I am happy to report that the Gunnar Optiks ATT-00101 Attache Gaming Computer Glasses have been a game-changer for me. These glasses offer great protection for my eyes while providing optimal comfort and style. While there are minor inconveniences, such as the dirty lenses and reflection on Zoom calls, I believe the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. If you're a heavy screen user or someone who experiences regular eye strain and discomfort, I highly recommend giving these glasses a try. 


### [Stylish Modern Convertible Sleeper Chair](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=stylish-modern-convertible-sleeper-chair)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-optiks-sheadog-advanced-computer-eyewear-1"><img alt="gunnar-optiks-sheadog-advanced-computer-eyewear-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-optiks-sheadog-advanced-computer-eyewear-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first laid my eyes on Gunnar's Sheadog gaming glasses, I was skeptical. But after nearly six months of regular use, I must admit that I'm a total convert! 

The first thing you'll notice is how comfortable these glasses are. They're light as a feather and feel like they're barely there when you're wearing them. The nose pads may not be adjustable, but they fit perfectly on my bridge without any modification needed. 

One of the key features of these glasses is their lens technology. They filter out harmful blue light and UV rays, which can lead to eye strain, headaches, and even reduce the risk of long-term damage like cataracts and macular degeneration. I've found that when I wear these glasses for extended periods, especially during late-night gaming sessions, I experience significantly less eye fatigue and fewer headaches. 

However, not everything about these glasses is perfect. While the lens quality is top-notch and resistant to scratches, the price tag can be a bit steep for some people. Additionally, they don't offer much in terms of adjustability, so if you have a unique face shape or require glasses with specific measurements, you might want to consider other options. 

Despite these minor drawbacks, I believe that Gunnar's Sheadog gaming glasses are worth every penny. They've made a significant difference in my overall comfort and productivity while using screens for extended periods. If you're someone who spends a lot of time in front of a computer or playing video games, I highly recommend giving these glasses a try!

As an avid gamer and tech enthusiast, I recently purchased the Gunnar Attache Tortoise-Rose Fade Frame Clear Gaming Glasses to protect my eyes from the harmful blue light emitted by screens. I've been using them daily for two weeks now and they have made a noticeable difference in reducing eye strain and discomfort while working on my computer or playing games. 

The first thing that stood out to me was their lightweight construction and proper weight balance. Unlike some other glasses I've tried, these don't feel heavy or cause pressure on my ears and nose, making them comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The nylon frame material and flexible hinges also add to their overall comfort. 

Another highlight is the patented GUNNAR lens material and tint. These glasses effectively block harmful blue light and 100% UV light, which is crucial for protecting my eyes from potential damage. I've noticed that my eyes feel less strained after extended periods of screen time, and I no longer experience the headaches that were becoming a common occurrence. 

However, there are a few minor cons. The lens tends to get dirty and marked up relatively quickly, requiring regular cleaning. Additionally, since they reflect blue light, they may give you blue robot eyes during Zoom calls if the light is reflected back onto the lenses. 

Overall, the Gunnar Attache Tortoise-Rose Fade Frame Clear Gaming Glasses have greatly improved my comfort while using digital devices, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable pair of gaming glasses.

These glasses are not only super stylish with their amber and onyx coloring, but they also offer practical benefits that have truly transformed my gaming experience. 

What stood out to me the most about the Vayper glasses was their lightweight design. The adjustable silicone nose pads and structural flexibility allowed the frame to rest comfortably on my face, making it feel like I wasn't even wearing them. This, combined with the ultra-slim temples and single-piece front design, made sure that they disappeared the moment I slipped them on. 

Additionally, the glasses offer a wrap-around feature, which prevents harmful blue light from sneaking in from the sides when you're gaming in the dark. And trust me, wearing these glasses during those late-night gaming sessions made a world of difference for me. 

However, despite all the positives, the glasses are relatively expensive, which might deter some people from giving them a try. Yet, considering how they've helped me keep my eyes relaxed and strain-free, I believe they're worth the investment for serious gamers like myself. 

In conclusion, if you're someone who spends hours gazing at computer screens or playing video games, I highly recommend giving GUNNAR Vayper gaming glasses a go.

From the moment I put them on, I noticed an instant difference in how my eyes felt after long hours in front of the computer. The amber lens contrast and anti-reflective coatings do a remarkable job of reducing eye strain, headaches, and fatigue.

The sleek, minimalist design paired with their lightweight build makes them incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods.

However, there are some areas where I feel the Gunnar Vayper could use some improvement. Firstly, the glasses are a bit pricey, which might deter some potential buyers who are on a tight budget.

All in all, I would highly recommend the Gunnar Vayper glasses to anyone looking to enhance their gaming or computer work experience.

### [Stylish GUNNAR Cypher Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=stylish-gunnar-cypher-gaming-glasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-cypher-computer-glasses-onyx-amber-1"><img alt="gunnar-cypher-computer-glasses-onyx-amber-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-cypher-computer-glasses-onyx-amber-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who spends hours in front of a computer screen, I was excited to try out the Gunnar Cypher Computer Glasses in Onyx Amber. The first thing that stands out about these glasses is their unique half-rim design, giving them a stylish appeal that sets them apart from other computer glasses on the market. 

One of the things I appreciated most about these glasses is how comfortable they are to wear for long periods of time. The silicone nose pads sit comfortably on my nose and provide a snug and reliable fit, while the stainless steel material makes the temples durable and sturdy. This enables me to use them for extended periods without feeling discomfort or strain on my ears. 

Another feature I found particularly useful is the precision designed metal hinges and ultra-thin temples. These elements create stability and comfort for long-term wear, ensuring that I can focus on my work without being distracted by discomfort or annoyance. 

However, one area where these glasses could be improved is in their lens width. At 55mm, they are on the smaller side, which may not be suitable for everyone. Additionally, some users might prefer glasses with a darker amber tint to provide more protection from bright screens. 

In summary, the Gunnar Cypher Computer Glasses in Onyx Amber offer a combination of style, comfort, and durability that makes them a great choice for anyone who spends a significant amount of time in front of a computer screen. While they may not be perfect for everyone due to their lens width and tint, they are definitely worth considering for those looking to improve their eye health and reduce strain while using digital devices. 


### [Comfortable and Stylish Gunnar Torpedo-X Razer Edition Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=comfortable-and-stylish-gunnar-torpedo-x-razer-edition-gaming-glasses)

I've been using the Gunnar Torpedo-X Razer Edition gaming glasses for a while now and I must say, they've made my digital life so much easier. The glasses are incredibly comfortable and light, which means I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort. 

One thing that really stood out to me is the lens width - it's perfect for those long gaming sessions or extended work on the computer. And despite being non-polarized, the amber lens does an excellent job of reducing harmful blue light and addressing symptoms of digital eye strain. 

In terms of design, the semi-rimless, wide nylon frame is not only stylish but also allows for optimal panoramic viewing. The wrap-around frame combined with GUNNAR's patented lens curve helps further mitigate dry eyes, which is a major bonus. 

The included interchangeable temple strap is a nice touch too. It's incredibly comfortable, especially when wearing a headset. Also, the lens coatings are top-notch, providing anti-reflective and smudge-resistant protection throughout. 

However, there's one issue that I've encountered – the lens clarity isn't as good as I'd have liked. It can make things look slightly blurrier than usual, which might be off-putting for some users. Additionally, some users have reported issues with the nose piece's height, which can make the glasses look awkward on the face. 

Overall, the Gunnar Torpedo-X Razer Edition gaming glasses have improved my digital experience tremendously. They're comfortable, stylish, and do a great job of reducing digital eye strain. While there might be some minor flaws, these glasses are definitely worth checking out if you're tired of putting up with dry, strained eyes.

These aren't just your average glasses, they're the ultimate secret weapon for every 6-Siege operative. 

The first thing that caught my attention was the Amber-React adaptive lens. It's not just a marketing gimmick; it truly makes a difference. Whether I'm playing indoors or outdoors, these glasses adjust perfectly to my environment, ensuring optimal visibility without any glare or distortion. 

Another feature I absolutely love is the semi-rimless frame design. Unlike traditional glasses, this one doesn't obstruct my view while playing. It provides a completely unobstructed field of view, which is especially crucial in fast-paced games like 6-Siege. 

But what really sets these glasses apart is their ability to block harmful blue light and 100% UV light. Gunnar's proprietary lens material and tint do an incredible job of keeping my eyes protected from strain and fatigue. And let's not forget about the anti-reflective lens coatings on the front and back of the lens. They significantly enhance clarity and reduce glare, making it easier for me to track enemies and spot hidden traps. 

However, there are some cons worth mentioning. The silicone hard-coated lens, although effective in preventing scratches, can sometimes feel a bit too bulky for prolonged gaming sessions. And while the unisex frame design is quite sleek, some users might find it slightly uncomfortable depending on their personal preferences. 

In conclusion, if you're serious about your gaming performance and want to take your 6-Siege game to the next level, then look no further than the Gunnar Gaming Glasses - Ash Edition. They may not make you a pro overnight, but they'll definitely give you a fighting chance against your opponents.

I recently got the Gunnar Cruz Onyx Teal / Amber glasses to reduce the strain on my eyes from long hours of digital usage. I was skeptical at first, but boy, was I amazed by the comfort and effectiveness of these glasses! The nylon frame feels incredibly light on my face, and the hingeless design gives it just the right amount of flexibility. Plus, the lenses are smudge-resistant, so they stay clear even after hours of use.

I've noticed a significant improvement in the quality of my sleep and overall eye comfort since I started using these glasses. The curved nose rest also ensures even weight distribution, which reduces any discomfort during extended wear. 

However, one minor drawback I experienced was a slight adjustment period with the lens tint. It took me a couple of weeks to get used to the slightly amber color, but once I did, I couldn't imagine not having them on during my daily screen sessions. 

The protective glasses case and clip provided with the glasses make it easy to keep them safe and organized when I'm not using them. Overall, I'm incredibly happy with my Gunnar Cruz glasses and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to reduce digital eye strain and protect their eyes.

However, I must admit that the glasses are somewhat heavy, which might be an issue for some users with sensitive noses. Additionally, a few reviewers mentioned experiencing some eye burn and lack of focus while using these glasses. Even though I didn't experience these issues myself, it's worth considering these potential downsides before making a purchase.

The amber lenses help cut down on harmful blue light and UV rays, reducing the strain on my eyes and making marathons of gaming sessions comfortable and enjoyable.

One minor issue I've noticed is that the glasses can smudge easily, which can be a bit of a pain when cleaning them.

As a tech enthusiast who spends hours in front of a screen, I've always struggled with eye strain and fatigue. However, since I started using these glasses, I've noticed a considerable reduction in both.

The imported nylon frame and glass lens exude durability, while the non-polarized feature keeps colors vibrant without compromising on UV protection.

This enhances focus and sharpens detail, making it easier to concentrate on tasks without straining my eyes. The high-index lens material eliminates distortion, providing an incredibly clear image. 

Another highlight is the lens coating that reduces glare and reflective light, minimizing visual distractions and stress. Coupled with the lens tint that filters blue light and blocks UV rays, my eyes stay protected from the harmful effects of digital screens. 

However, one minor drawback is the logo placement on the top corner of the frame which can be slightly annoying. But overall, these glasses have been a game-changer for me as a gamer and someone who frequently uses screens. 

So if you're tired of dealing with eye strain and fatigue from prolonged screen exposure, I highly recommend giving these Gunnar Oakland Onyx / Amber glasses a shot. They might just become your new best friend!

On the downside, the glasses' tight fit may cause discomfort for some users, especially those with larger heads. It would be great if there were a size guide available to ensure a perfect fit.

The comfortable fit, durable construction, and effective blue light filtering make them a worthwhile investment. However, be prepared for a potential tight fit and slightly reduced side vision.

I've been using the Gunnar Enigma glasses for a while now, and I must say, they've made a huge difference in my gaming experience. The glasses come in this cool Assassin's Creed: Valhalla design, complete with a branded pouch and flat fold case. 

The lens of the glasses is where the magic happens. It's wide format, allowing me to see every little detail in the game. But the real star is the lens itself - it's smudge-resistant and anti-glare, which means my screen is always clear and free from distracting glares. 

Quality engineering of the glasses is evident in the sturdy rigid lens mounting, comfort curved nose rests, and multi-barrel hinges. I've worn them for hours and they still feel comfortable. The only real downside is that they slightly magnify, making objects appear a little larger. 

Gunnar's patented amber lens is another feature that I love. It helps me play for longer periods and improves my focus. Plus, it blocks 65% of harmful blue light and provides 100% UV protection. I find that my eyes feel less strained after long gaming sessions. 

However, the glasses don't come in different sizes, which could be a problem if you have a very asymmetric nose. The nose area also can't be adjusted, which might cause some discomfort. 

Overall, I'm really happy with the Gunnar Enigma glasses. They're well-made, comfortable, and provide great protection for my eyes. If you're looking for a pair of gaming glasses, I highly recommend giving these a try. 


### [GUNNAR Stark Industries Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-stark-industries-gaming-glasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/gunnar-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=gunnar-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-stark-industries-glasses-1"><img alt="gunnar-stark-industries-glasses-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-stark-industries-glasses-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who spends countless hours in front of a computer screen, I was excited to try out GUNNAR's Stark Industries glasses. I'll be honest, at first, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from these Tony Stark-inspired frames. But after a few weeks of wearing them during my daily work routine, I can definitely say that they've made a positive impact on my overall comfort and eye health. 

The lightweight stainless steel frame is comfortable and doesn't feel too heavy on my ears, even after an entire workday. The multi-barrel hinge provides a nice secure fit, which is especially important given that I have a somewhat larger head size. The lens coating seems to be quite durable as well, resisting smudges and scratches with ease. 

One feature that really stands out to me is the blue light filter. It's hard to explain, but after wearing these glasses for a while, I noticed that my eyes didn't feel as strained at the end of the day. I can't say for certain if it's the lens coating or just a placebo effect, but I've definitely been more comfortable while working on long projects. 

However, there are a couple of downsides worth mentioning. First, as I mentioned earlier, the glasses do run a bit large. I wish there were more adjustment options available so that I could fine-tune the fit to my own head size. Second, while the glasses do block harmful blue light, they don't completely eliminate glare. This wasn't a major issue for me, but it might be for others who are more sensitive to light. 

Overall, I give these GUNNAR Stark Industries glasses a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars. They're comfortable, stylish, and provide a noticeable difference in reducing eye strain. While they're not perfect, they're definitely worth considering if you spend a lot of time in front of screens like I do.

Another notable feature is the lightweight construction and proper weight balance, ensuring that they remain comfortable even during extended gaming sessions. The 3-barrel hinge adds to the overall durability and flexibility of the frame, making it easy to adjust the fit as needed. 

However, one minor downside I experienced was that the glasses could press a little bit against my nose after wearing them for several hours. While this wasn't too much of an issue for me, it might be worth considering if you're particularly sensitive to pressure points in your eyewear. 

In conclusion, I believe the Gunnar Gaming & Computer Glasses are an excellent investment for anyone who spends a significant amount of time in front of a screen.
