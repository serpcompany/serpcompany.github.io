### [Razer Orochi V2: Quartz Edition - Wireless Mobile Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-orochi-v2-quartz-edition-wireless-mobile-gaming-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-orochi-v2-quartz-edition-mobile-wireless-gaming-mouse-1"><img alt="razer-orochi-v2-quartz-edition-mobile-wireless-gaming-mouse-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-orochi-v2-quartz-edition-mobile-wireless-gaming-mouse-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

My first ever Razer Orochi V2 - Quartz Edition arrived in the mail and, boy, let me tell you, this little thing has made an impressive impact on my daily activities. This sleek, lightweight mouse is perfect for those who demand the best in performance and comfort - I sure do! The mouse's ambidextrous design caters to both right and left-handed gamers, making it a truly versatile companion. 

One feature that really stood out for me was the Dual Wireless Modes. It's been a revelation for me with both its Razer HyperSpeed Wireless and Bluetooth modes, allowing seamless connectivity no matter where I am. Couple that with the ultra-long battery life and you've got a recipe for an unbeatable gaming experience that lasts. 

However, one drawback I had was the Bluetooth connectivity's lack of reliability. Sometimes it tends to fall asleep, requiring time-consuming and irritating reboots. The USB dongle, on the other hand, provides a slightly more precise and responsive connection, though it does require a bit of adjustment when switching between the two modes. 

Despite this minor issue, the Razer Orochi V2 Quartz Edition truly impresses with its performance and ease of use. It fits perfectly in my hand, and the lightweight design makes it a pleasure to use for extended periods. The adjustable DPI settings offer a high degree of customization, helping me tailor my mouse settings to suit any game I play. 

So, there you have it, my personal experience with the Razer Orochi V2 - Quartz Edition. While it's not perfect, the good significantly outweighs the bad. I wholeheartedly recommend it to gamers who are looking for a high-performance mouse that won't break the bank. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed! 


### [Aula SC100 Wireless Rechargeable Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=aula-sc100-wireless-rechargeable-gaming-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=aula-sc100-wireless-gaming-mouse-rgb-rechargeable-2400dpi-gaming-mouse-7-buttons-ergonomic-optical-u-1"><img alt="aula-sc100-wireless-gaming-mouse-rgb-rechargeable-2400dpi-gaming-mouse-7-buttons-ergonomic-optical-u-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/aula-sc100-wireless-gaming-mouse-rgb-rechargeable-2400dpi-gaming-mouse-7-buttons-ergonomic-optical-u-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently started using the Aula SC100 Wireless Gaming Mouse and I must say, it has transformed my gaming experience. The mouse boasts a comfortable ergonomic design that perfectly fits my hand, making it incredibly easy to use for extended periods of time. 

One of the standout features of this gaming mouse is its silent click feature. When playing late into the night, this helped significantly in keeping noise levels down, ensuring my roommates or family members were not disturbed by my intense gaming sessions. 

The Aula SC100 also offers impressive customization options. Its three adjustable DPI levels - 800, 1200, and 1600 - allow me to modify the cursor sensitivity depending on whether I'm playing a game or just browsing the web. Additionally, the 800mAh rechargeable battery ensures I can keep going without worrying about constantly replacing batteries. 

However, one minor drawback that I have noticed is that the colorful LED breathing backlight can be a little too bright for my taste. I ended up covering them with some electrical tape to dim them down a bit. 

Overall, the Aula SC100 Wireless Gaming Mouse is a high-quality product with many appealing features. It's perfect for gamers who want a comfortable and silent mouse that offers customizable settings. Highly recommended! 


### [HyperX Pulsefire Haste Ultra-Lightweight Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=hyperx-pulsefire-haste-ultra-lightweight-gaming-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=pulsefire-haste-lightweight-gaming-mouse-hyperx-white-pink-1"><img alt="pulsefire-haste-lightweight-gaming-mouse-hyperx-white-pink-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/pulsefire-haste-lightweight-gaming-mouse-hyperx-white-pink-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I can't tell you how happy I am with my new Pulsefire Haste Lightweight Gaming Mouse from HyperX. This isn't your average mouse, it's a total game changer! 

Let me start with what I loved most about it: The Ultra-light Hex Shell Design. It feels like I'm using a mouse that's barely there, which is perfect for those intense gaming sessions where every second counts. The hexagonal holes in the shell make the mouse super lightweight, but don't worry, it's still very durable. 

Next, we have the TTC Golden micro dustproof switches. These switches are incredibly satisfying to click. They provide a solid feedback with each click and they're rated for 60 million clicks, so I know they'll last me a long time. Plus, they're dustproof which is a nice touch. 

The HyperFlex USB Cable is another noteworthy feature. It's made from light, flexible paracord material that reduces tension and resistance for smoother mouse movement. I didn't think a wire could make such a difference, but this one does! 

The Pure Virgin-Grade PTFE skates are another highlight. They provide a really smooth glide on my mousepad. I've had other mice that felt a bit sticky, but not this one. The low-friction skates help me make those quick, precise movements during gameplay. 

Finally, the Grip Tape included with the mouse is a nice touch. It provides extra grip and control, making it comfortable to use for long periods of time. 

However, some users found issue with the grip tape, stating that it doesn't feel comfortable in their hands. But for me, the mouse feels great without it. 

Overall, the Pulsefire Haste Lightweight Gaming Mouse from HyperX is an excellent mouse. It's light, responsive, and comfortable to use. Plus, with its customizable features via the HyperX NGENUITY Software, it's fully personalizable to your taste. If you're looking for a high-performance gaming mouse without breaking the bank, this mouse is definitely worth checking out! 


### [VEGCOO C10 Wireless Gaming Mouse with LED Lights](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=vegcoo-c10-wireless-gaming-mouse-with-led-lights)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=vegcoo-c10-wireless-gaming-mouse-rechargeable-silent-optical-mice-7-colors-led-lights-7-buttons-2401"><img alt="vegcoo-c10-wireless-gaming-mouse-rechargeable-silent-optical-mice-7-colors-led-lights-7-buttons-2401" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/vegcoo-c10-wireless-gaming-mouse-rechargeable-silent-optical-mice-7-colors-led-lights-7-buttons-2401/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a die-hard gamer who's always on the lookout for the perfect accessory, I recently got my hands on the VEGCOO C10 Wireless Gaming Mouse. This little gadget has quickly become an indispensable part of my gaming setup, with its vibrant LED lights, precise tracking, and quiet operation that doesn't disturb those around me. 

The wireless connectivity is a game-changer for me, letting me conveniently connect with my PC or laptop without any tangled cords getting in the way. And speaking of convenience, the fact that it's rechargeable means I never have to worry about running out of batteries mid-game. 

One thing to note, though, is that in well-lit environments, the LED lights may not be as bright as in darker settings. But for me, this hasn't been much of an issue since I mostly play at night or in dimly lit rooms. 

Another highlight worth mentioning is how comfortable this mouse feels in my hand. The buttons are easy to reach and provide a satisfying click, while the scroll wheel operates smoothly and quietly. 

Overall, I can't recommend the VEGCOO C10 Wireless Gaming Mouse enough for anyone who spends a lot of time playing games on their computer. It's stylish, functional, and best of all, affordable. 


### [Razer Viper V2 Pro Ultra-Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-viper-v2-pro-ultra-lightweight-wireless-gaming-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-viper-v2-pro-ultra-lightweight-wireless-gaming-mouse-white-1"><img alt="razer-viper-v2-pro-ultra-lightweight-wireless-gaming-mouse-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-viper-v2-pro-ultra-lightweight-wireless-gaming-mouse-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

From the moment I unboxed my Razer Viper V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse, I knew this was going to be an unforgettable experience. As a professional gamer, I had high expectations for this sleek, lightweight device and I wasn't disappointed. 

The first thing that caught my eye was its striking resemblance to a minimalist work of art. The solid case with a matte finish was surprisingly comfortable in my hand and the fact that it's one of the lightest wireless gaming mice ever made only added to its appeal. 

Moreover, the sensor on this bad boy is second to none. It's got a resolution of 30,000 DPI and can be fully adjusted using Razer's Synapse software utility (or even without, using the button on the mouse). I had a blast playing with the settings and achieving mind-blowing precision while using it on various surfaces, including glass. 

Moving on, the buttons are super responsive thanks to their optical switches. They gave me the same satisfying tactile feedback that I'm used to from conventional mechanical switches, without any added weight. Plus, the battery life is simply amazing - up to 70 continuous hours! 

However, there were a couple of cons that I couldn't ignore. For starters, the mouse lacks some key features like horizontal scrolling, which can be quite inconvenient at times. And while the sensor is top-notch, there's no on-the-fly adjustment feature, making it a set-it-and-forget-it device. 

In summary, the Razer Viper V2 Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a high-performance gaming mouse. Its lightweight design, amazing sensor, and responsive buttons make it stand out from the crowd. Just remember, if you're more of a casual gamer or a fan of extra features, you might want to consider something else.

As an avid gamer, I couldn't resist trying out the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless Gaming Mouse. Trust me, this isn't your regular gaming mouse. The first thing that blew me away was its ultra-lightweight design. Weighing just 53g, it felt like holding air in my hand, making it incredibly easy to maneuver during intense gaming sessions. 

The performance of this mouse is equally impressive. The precision HyperX 26K Sensor ensures responsiveness and accuracy, while the 8000Hz polling rate and custom HyperX switches guarantee flawless performance. Plus, with up to 100 hours of battery life, you won't find yourself stuck mid-game needing a recharge. 

However, no product is perfect. I did notice some minor drawbacks. The high-frequency coil whine when charging can be a bit distracting, but fortunately, it's not an issue when playing wirelessly. 

In conclusion, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Wireless Gaming Mouse is a fantastic option for gamers looking for a top-notch performance without sacrificing comfort. Its lightweight design, superior sensor technology, and long battery life make it an excellent choice for both casual and competitive gamers alike. Just be prepared for a minor annoyance during charging. 


### [Logitech Silent B220 Wireless Mouse, Black](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=logitech-silent-b220-wireless-mouse-black)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=logitech-silent-b220-mouse-black-1"><img alt="logitech-silent-b220-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/logitech-silent-b220-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Living in a shared apartment, my roommate and I were searching for something silent yet efficient. And that's when we came across the Logitech Silent B220 Mouse. It's been a game-changer for our late-night research sessions. 

The quiet click of the buttons is just amazing - it's like you're typing on a pillow. As a graphic designer, I'm not much of a gamer, but this mouse has been reliable and comfortable to use for long hours. The 1000 DPI is more than sufficient for my needs, and the scroll wheel adds a nice touch. 

I appreciate how it connects wirelessly through RF technology, making it easy to set up and use without needing to be within range of a blinking dongle. Plus, receiving it with the batteries already included was an extra bonus. 

There is one issue though; the scroll wheel tends to be a bit noisy. Don't get me wrong, it's nowhere close to the old-school mouse scrolling sound, but the optical tracking technology in this mouse could be improved slightly for a smoother experience. 

In conclusion, the Logitech Silent B220 Mouse has been a real asset for all-day work sessions without disturbing my roommate or others. Despite the slightly noisy scroll wheel, this has been an excellent purchase for both of us. 


### [Speedlink Calado Silent Wireless Mouse for Quiet Performance](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=speedlink-calado-silent-wireless-mouse-for-quiet-performance)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=speedlink-calado-silent-sl-6343-rrbk-wireless-mouse-usb-black-1"><img alt="speedlink-calado-silent-sl-6343-rrbk-wireless-mouse-usb-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/speedlink-calado-silent-sl-6343-rrbk-wireless-mouse-usb-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently purchased the Speedlink Calado Silent mouse, and I must say, I've been thoroughly impressed. The advanced button technology effectively eliminates the noise you make when using the mouse, making clicks almost completely silent. This feature ensures a quiet and peaceful environment in the office or while gaming, helping maintain composure and focus. 

The mouse fits perfectly in my right hand, ensuring a relaxed and smooth grip during use. Its compact design and premium, non-slip rubber coating provide precision and fluid tracking, with a sensor resolution of up to 1,600dpi. The wireless technology offers up to 8 meters of freedom, allowing me to comfortably navigate without any cords getting in the way. 

The power-saving feature and automatic stand-by mode are also significant highlights, helping to reduce energy consumption while maximizing battery life. With batteries included, this mouse is ready to go right out of the box. 

However, I have experienced a few downsides with this product. The packaging is excessively large for such a small mouse, making it difficult to store or dispose of responsibly. Additionally, a few users have reported issues with the device's connectivity and longevity. 

Despite these minor cons, I believe the Speedlink Calado Silent mouse offers exceptional value for its price. It's a perfect blend of performance, comfort, and silence that has significantly improved my daily work and gaming experience.

### [Logitech B330 Silent Plus Wireless Optical Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=logitech-b330-silent-plus-wireless-optical-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/silent-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=silent-gaming-mouse&utm_term=logitech-b330-silent-plus-wireless-optical-mouse-black-1"><img alt="logitech-b330-silent-plus-wireless-optical-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/logitech-b330-silent-plus-wireless-optical-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Logitech B330 Silent Plus Wireless Optical Mouse is all about silent efficiency. As someone who spends a lot of time on the computer, I've been searching for a mouse that doesn't make a racket but still performs well. This mouse delivers just that, with a noise reduction of over 90%. 

One of my favorite features is its silent clicking. Even though it's not completely silent, it's significantly quieter than my old mouse and doesn't disturb those around me. The RF wireless connection provides a stable and reliable link, and the optical tracking method produces smooth and responsive movements. 

However, one minor issue I encountered was the scroll wheel. It's a little stiff, which can be annoying when I need to scroll through a long document. Also, the mouse's design is quite basic. While it's comfortable to hold, it doesn't have some of the ergonomic features found on more expensive mice. 

Overall, the Logitech B330 Silent Plus Wireless Optical Mouse is a great choice for those looking for a silent and reliable mouse at an affordable price. Its silent clicking is a real bonus, especially in quiet environments, and its reliable connection ensures a smooth computing experience. However, the stiffness of the scroll wheel and the basic design may be drawbacks for some users.

This little device lives up to its promise of being ultra-silent, significantly reducing mouse click noise by up to 90 percent.

One standout feature of this mouse is its high-definition bi-directional switch, which allows for seamless precision and control. It's impressive how it effortlessly switches between high and low dpi settings, making gameplay smoother than ever. Additionally, the power-saving engine ensures super low power consumption, extending the battery life for a more sustainable usage. 

However, one issue I've encountered with this mouse is its sleep mode setting. After a short period of inactivity, it goes into sleep mode, requiring me to turn it off and on again to get it working. While it's not a deal breaker, I wish there was a way to disable this feature or modify its inactivity duration. 

All in all, the Bornd M120 Wireless Silent Mouse has become an essential part of my home and office setup. Its cross-interface compatibility ensures versatility across various devices, making it a perfect fit for tech enthusiasts who value convenience and performance.
