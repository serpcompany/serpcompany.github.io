### [Glorious Model O Matte White: Feather-Light, Braided Cable, G-Skates](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=glorious-model-o-matte-white-feather-light-braided-cable-g-skates)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1"><img alt="glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-model-o-gaming-mouse-matte-white-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a product review content writer, I recently had the chance to use the Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse in Matte White. This sleek and lightweight mouse has quickly become my go-to for gaming sessions, offering a comfortable feel and impressive performance. 

The first thing that caught my attention was the unique honeycomb design of the shell. It not only makes the mouse incredibly lightweight but also provides excellent ventilation, keeping my palms cool and dry during intense gaming sessions. Cleaning the mouse is also a breeze, thanks to the air canister method. 

The proprietary Ascended Cord is another standout feature. It's incredibly flexible and lightweight, providing an almost wireless feel without any hindrance or discomfort. Additionally, the Glorious Model O comes with G-Skates Feet, which are made of 100% pure Virgin PTFE and feature rounded edges that prevent snagging on mousepads. 

One of the most impressive aspects of this gaming mouse is its dedicated DPI indicator. You can set it to any value and color of your choice, allowing you to easily adjust your settings on the fly. Furthermore, the Glorious Model O boasts competitive E-Sports industry standards, including pixel-perfect tracking, zero mouse acceleration, and a 1000 Hz polling rate. 

Despite these impressive features, there are a few minor drawbacks. Some users report that the right-click button tends to make a different sound or feel if pressed too hard, which can be slightly disconcerting during gameplay. Additionally, the build quality may not be on par with higher-end mice from Logitech or Razer, although this is subjective and depends on individual preferences. 

Overall, the Glorious Model O Gaming Mouse is an excellent choice for gamers seeking a lightweight, comfortable, and high-performing mouse. Its unique design, impressive features, and solid performance make it a worthy contender in the world of gaming peripherals.

I recently started using the Redragon Predator M612 gaming mouse and I have to say, it's made a huge difference in my gameplay. The first thing that stood out was the adjustable DPI levels which let me fine-tune the sensitivity on the fly depending on the game I'm playing or the weapon I'm using. This is a great feature that I think all gamers will appreciate. 

The grip on this mouse is also excellent. It's comfortable to hold for long periods of time and the rubberized thumb grip helps me maintain better control over my movements. The buttons are well placed and fully programmable, making it easy to match my gameplay style. 

One downside I noticed is that the cable can sometimes get in the way, especially when I'm playing games that require quick movements.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse-black-1"><img alt="hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-gaming-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Having spent a considerable amount of time using HyperX's Pulsefire Haste gaming mouse, I must say it's quite a revelation! First off, it's incredibly light at just 59 grams, making it feel almost weightless in my hand. Gaming for extended periods is now more comfortable than ever. The customizable DPI settings, RGB lighting, and button assignments through the HyperX NGENUITY Software make personalizing it a breeze. 

One aspect that really stands out to me is the ultra-light hex shell design. The honeycomb-structure not only makes it lighter than your average mouse but also allows for better airflow, keeping my hand nice and dry during intense gaming sessions. 

Another highlight is the cable. The HyperFlex USB Cable is made from light, flexible paracord material. This reduces tension and resistance, giving me more control over the mouse - kind of like using a wireless one. 

The TTC Golden micro dustproof switches are a dream come true for gamers. They feel super satisfying to click, providing a solid tactile feedback, and they're rated for up to 60 million clicks, ensuring they'll last me through countless battles. 

However, it isn't all roses. One minor issue is that the mouse is so light and the cable so flexible that it doesn't always stay exactly where I put it. This wasn't a significant problem but it was noticeable. 

All in all, the HyperX Pulsefire Haste is a top-notch choice for gamers who want both performance and comfort. The combination of features like the ultralight hex shell, TTC Golden micro switches, and the flexible HyperFlex cable makes it a tough contender. It's not perfect - nothing is - but it's definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a new gaming mouse.

One of the highlights of this mouse is its 18000 DPI sensor which helped me achieve precise movements while playing. It's amazing how smooth and responsive it felt, giving me a competitive edge during intense battles. 

However, there are some cons worth mentioning. I found the scroll wheel a bit too sensitive at times, causing unwanted scrolling or scrolling in the opposite direction.

One feature that I particularly love is the DPI change button. It allows me to adjust the speed of my mouse movement on the fly, making it easier for me to navigate different games at varying speeds. And let's not forget about the buttons on the left side of the mouse, designed to help me fast forward or rewind in-game content seamlessly. 

In terms of ergonomics, this MeeTion mouse truly delivers. Its better design and surface treatment provide a comfortable feel that enhances performance and ensures longer service life. I can confidently say that investing in this mouse has greatly improved my gaming experience. 

However, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. Some users have reported issues with the quality of the buttons and the overall build quality. Additionally, the lack of a full-fledged RGB backlight feature might not satisfy some gamers who prefer more customization options. 

Overall, the MeeTion PC Gaming Mouse Wired with RGB Chroma Backlit is a solid choice for budget-conscious gamers looking for a reliable and comfortable option.

As for the mouse itself, I found it incredibly comfortable to use, even during marathon gaming sessions. It's lightweight and easy to control, which is a big plus for me.

Translation? It's super accurate and responsive, allowing me to make quick movements and maintain pinpoint precision while playing. 

The custom HyperX Switches in this mouse are another highlight worth mentioning. They provide tactile feedback on each click, and they're built to last â€“ with an impressive lifespan of up to 100 million clicks.

### [Razer Viper Wired Ambidextrous Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-viper-wired-ambidextrous-gaming-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-viper-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-chroma-rgb-lighting-1"><img alt="razer-viper-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-chroma-rgb-lighting-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-viper-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-chroma-rgb-lighting-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

A few weeks ago, I decided to ditch my trusty 15-year-old mouse and upgrade to a more advanced one. I was torn between a few options, but I went with the Razer Viper Wired Optical Gaming Mouse with Chroma RGB Lighting as it came highly recommended and promised an excellent gaming experience. 

Now, I must say that this mouse has exceeded all expectations. The moment I held it in my hand, I was immediately impressed by its ambidextrous design, which accommodates both left and right-handed users. This is a fantastic feature as it allows me to play with either hand without any discomfort or awkwardness. The customizable Chroma RGB color profiles are also a nice touch, letting me choose from more than 16.8 million color combinations to create a unique look that matches my preferences and setup. 

One of the key highlights for me is the eight programmable buttons. These buttons allow me to reconfigure and assign complex macro functions through Razer Synapse 3, making it easier and more efficient to play games that require multiple button inputs. Additionally, the drag-free cord has been a game-changer, eliminating the need for a mouse bungee and significantly reducing the weight and drag, giving me a wireless-like performance. 

However, no product is perfect, and the Razer Viper is no exception. The placement of the DPI button on the bottom of the mouse can be a bit cumbersome, as it requires me to move the mouse quite a bit to change the sensitivity, but that's a minor inconvenience in an otherwise excellent product. 

To sum it up, the Razer Viper Wired Optical Gaming Mouse with Chroma RGB Lighting has taken my gaming experience to the next level. Its ambidextrous design, customizable color profiles, and programmable buttons make it the perfect choice for both casual and competitive gamers alike. The only downside is the placement of the DPI button, but it's a minor inconvenience that doesn't overshadow the incredible performance and features this mouse has to offer. 


### [HyperX Pulsefire Core - Ambidextrous RGB Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=hyperx-pulsefire-core-ambidextrous-rgb-gaming-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=hyperx-pulsefire-core-gaming-mouse-black-1"><img alt="hyperx-pulsefire-core-gaming-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/hyperx-pulsefire-core-gaming-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using the HyperX Pulsefire Core as my go-to gaming mouse and it's been a pleasure. The first thing that caught my attention was its ergonomic design, with textured side grips that provide a comfortable, no-slip grip even during intense gaming sessions. The symmetrical shape is suitable for both palm and claw grip, making it versatile and accessible. 

The Pixart 3327 optical sensor is another highlight of this mouse. It ensures precise, smooth tracking with no hardware acceleration and has native DPI settings up to 6200 DPI. This has been a game-changer for me, especially in first-person shooters where pinpoint accuracy is crucial. 

Customization is easy and convenient with HyperX NGENUITY software. This allows you to set up your mouse just the way you want it, customizing lighting, DPI settings, and macros for 7 programmable buttons. 

However, there are some downsides to the Pulsefire Core. The build quality, while decent, could use some improvement. The plastic on the main buttons feels a bit flimsy and the right side has a lot of give, which can be distracting at times. Additionally, the software needs some polishing - it doesn't work on all systems and can be a bit finicky at times. 

All in all, the HyperX Pulsefire Core is a solid choice for gamers looking for a comfortable, customizable gaming mouse on a budget. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive options, it delivers on the essentials and provides a great gaming experience.

As an avid gamer, I was on the lookout for a reliable gaming mouse that wouldn't break the bank. The HyperX Pulsefire Core RGB Gaming Mouse was a perfect fit for me. The Pixart 3327 optical sensor provides smooth, precise tracking, and the customizable DPI settings are a nice touch. The ergonomic design and textured side grips make it comfortable to use, even during long gaming sessions. 

One of the standout features of this mouse is its seven programmable buttons, which can be easily customized using the HyperX NGenuity software. The software is user-friendly and allows you to create macros, customize lighting, and adjust the DPI settings to your liking. Additionally, the large skates enable accurate aiming and provide a smooth glide across my mousepad. 

However, there's a small issue with the side buttons. They are located quite close to the thumb, which can lead to accidental clicks in the heat of the game. This can be frustrating, but it's not a deal-breaker. 

Another downside is that the RGB lighting isn't as customizable as I'd like. The HyperX NGenuity software only offers a single adjustable LED feature, which I found a bit limiting. 

Overall, the HyperX Pulsefire Core RGB Gaming Mouse is a solid choice for gamers who want a comfortable, well-performing mouse without spending a fortune. The customizable buttons, DPI settings, and adjustable lighting make it easy to tailor the mouse to your specific needs. While there are some minor issues with the side buttons and RGB customization, these minor drawbacks don't detract from the overall quality and performance of the mouse.

Plus, it's incredibly rugged and durable, it's ready for battle, no matter how intense the gameplay gets. 

However, there's one thing that I found a bit frustrating.

I think adding an option to disable them could make this already impressive mouse even better. 

All in all, the Asus TUF Gaming M3 is a high-quality, reliable, and comfortable mouse that I wholeheartedly recommend to all gamers out there. Its performance, durability, and style make it a great choice for anyone who wants to enhance their gaming experience.

The on-board memory is another fantastic feature, making it easy to save polling rate, keybinds, and 5 CPIs directly on the mouse, so I can have the perfect settings from game to game and on-the-go. 

However, there are a few minor drawbacks to this mouse. The scroll wheel, while still functional, could be more responsive and faster. Additionally, the software required to customize the lighting effects seems a bit too complicated for a simple task. Overall, the SteelSeries Rival 3 Wired Gaming Mouse offers an exceptional gaming experience, with its impressive features and performance catering to both entry-level and hardcore gamers alike.

I can't tell you how happy I am with my new Pulsefire Haste Lightweight Gaming Mouse from HyperX. This isn't your average mouse, it's a total game changer! 

Let me start with what I loved most about it: The Ultra-light Hex Shell Design. It feels like I'm using a mouse that's barely there, which is perfect for those intense gaming sessions where every second counts. The hexagonal holes in the shell make the mouse super lightweight, but don't worry, it's still very durable. 

Next, we have the TTC Golden micro dustproof switches. These switches are incredibly satisfying to click. They provide a solid feedback with each click and they're rated for 60 million clicks, so I know they'll last me a long time. Plus, they're dustproof which is a nice touch. 

The HyperFlex USB Cable is another noteworthy feature. It's made from light, flexible paracord material that reduces tension and resistance for smoother mouse movement. I didn't think a wire could make such a difference, but this one does! 

The Pure Virgin-Grade PTFE skates are another highlight. They provide a really smooth glide on my mousepad. I've had other mice that felt a bit sticky, but not this one. The low-friction skates help me make those quick, precise movements during gameplay. 

Finally, the Grip Tape included with the mouse is a nice touch. It provides extra grip and control, making it comfortable to use for long periods of time. 

However, some users found issue with the grip tape, stating that it doesn't feel comfortable in their hands. But for me, the mouse feels great without it. 

Overall, the Pulsefire Haste Lightweight Gaming Mouse from HyperX is an excellent mouse. It's light, responsive, and comfortable to use.

However, there are a few downsides to this mouse. Firstly, the lack of adjustable weights might not suit everyone's preferences, especially those who prefer a more customizable feel. Additionally, the software for customizing the DPI settings can be a bit cumbersome to navigate. 

In conclusion, if you're a beginner or an intermediate gamer looking for an affordable and reliable gaming mouse, the Lenovo Legion M200 RGB Gaming Mouse is definitely worth considering. Its comfortable design, customizable backlight, and braided cable make it a great choice for anyone who wants to upgrade their gaming setup without breaking the bank.

However, the Glorious Model O Wired Mouse Pink isn't without its flaws. I found the software to be slightly cumbersome, requiring separate installations for older and newer models. Additionally, some users have reported issues with the scroll wheel and the quality of the mouse feet. Despite these minor setbacks, the Glorious Model O Wired Mouse Pink truly shines as a brilliant addition to any gaming setup.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-viper-mini-gaming-mouse-black-1"><img alt="razer-viper-mini-gaming-mouse-black-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-viper-mini-gaming-mouse-black-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to try out the Razer Viper Mini gaming mouse, and I must say, it's been an exciting journey! As someone who spends a lot of time gaming, I know how important it is to have a reliable and comfortable mouse. The Viper Mini checks both these boxes beautifully, making it a joy to use. 

One of the first things that stood out to me is its lightweight design. Weighing in at just 61 grams, this mouse glides smoothly across my mousepad, helping me maintain control during intense gaming sessions. The highly flexible cable and Teflon feet also contribute to its effortless movement, allowing me to turn, aim, and shoot with minimal drag. 

Another feature that I appreciated is the ambidextrous design. As a left-handed gamer, it's often challenging to find mice that cater to my needs. However, the Razer Viper Mini doesn't disappoint in this regard. Its symmetrical shape and programmable buttons make it perfect for both left and right-handed gamers. 

The optical sensor on this mouse is truly impressive. With a sensitivity of up to 8500 DPI, I've experienced incredibly precise tracking, ensuring that my aim is always on point. The Razer Viper Mini also boasts 6 fully programmable buttons, which give me quick access to my favorite macros and extended moves with just a single click. 

As a fan of customizable lighting, I was thrilled to discover that the Viper Mini supports Razer Chroma lighting. This feature allows me to set up and synchronize my battle colors with other Razer gear, adding an extra layer of personalization to my gaming setup. 

However, no product is perfect, and the Razer Viper Mini is no exception. While its lightweight design is fantastic, it can sometimes feel a bit too light for my preference. Additionally, I've noticed that the scroll wheel can be a bit noisy at times. 

In summary, the Razer Viper Mini has become an integral part of my gaming experience. Its lightweight design, ambidextrous shape, and customizable features make it an excellent choice for gamers of all skill levels. While it may have a few minor drawbacks, the overall value and performance make it a worthy addition to any gaming setup.

As a reviewer who's had the chance to use this Razer Level Up Bundle, I can say it's a great package for gamers just starting out. The Kraken X Lite Wired Gaming Headset is incredibly lightweight and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with decent sound quality. The DeathAdder Essential Gaming Mouse has a 6,400 DPI sensor, offering precise control, and an ergonomic design that makes it comfortable to use even during marathon gaming sessions. The Gigantus V2 Medium Mouse Mat is also worth mentioning, featuring a micro-weave cloth surface that offers excellent tracking for the mouse. 

On the downside, the Kraken X Lite lacks in-line controls for volume and mute, which could be a significant inconvenience for some users. Additionally, the DeathAdder Essential doesn't have customizable DPI settings nor the 7.1 surround sound feature without using Razer Synapse software, which might affect some users' experience. 

The bundle is a good starter set for those looking to build a basic gaming rig, with a free gamepass entry to an online Razer Tournament to kick things off. Overall, the product is decent for its price, offering a solid combination of peripherals for an enjoyable gaming experience. 


### [Redragon RGB LED Wired Gaming Mouse with Programmable Buttons](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=redragon-rgb-led-wired-gaming-mouse-with-programmable-buttons)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=redragon-rgb-led-wired-gaming-mouse-18-programmable-mouse-buttons-1"><img alt="redragon-rgb-led-wired-gaming-mouse-18-programmable-mouse-buttons-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/redragon-rgb-led-wired-gaming-mouse-18-programmable-mouse-buttons-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Redragon RGB LED Wired Gaming Mouse, and I must say, this little gadget has totally transformed my gaming experience! As soon as I unboxed it, I was immediately impressed by its sleek and futuristic design. The mouse has 18 programmable buttons, which are perfect for all those shortcuts and hotkeys that can give you an advantage in game. 

One of the real highlights for me was the RGB backlighting. It's not just about the flashy colors, but more about the immersive effect it creates. Watching my mouse light up in sync with the game adds an extra layer of excitement to the whole experience. And the fact that you can customize the colors and effects through the software is just icing on the cake. 

On the comfort front, the mouse fits perfectly in my hand. It's neither too big nor too small, which is a common issue with other gaming mice I've used in the past. I've had it for about a month now and it's still as comfortable to use as it was on the first day. 

However, no product is without its downsides. In the case of this mouse, I did find the side buttons a bit too hard to press. They require a firm push, which can be a bit difficult if you're in the middle of an intense game. Also, the scroll wheel could be a bit smoother. It's not a deal breaker, but it would definitely be a nice improvement. 

All in all, I've had a fantastic experience with the Redragon RGB LED Wired Gaming Mouse. It's comfortable, precise, and looks great with its RGB lighting. If you're in the market for a new gaming mouse, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try.

### [Razer DeathAdder Essential - Optical Gaming Mouse](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-deathadder-essential-optical-gaming-mouse)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/wired-gaming-mouse?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=wired-gaming-mouse&utm_term=razer-deathadder-essential-optical-esports-gaming-mouse-1"><img alt="razer-deathadder-essential-optical-esports-gaming-mouse-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/razer-deathadder-essential-optical-esports-gaming-mouse-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The sensor is not only incredibly accurate but also incredibly responsive, allowing you to make even the smallest movements in-game with ease. 

One feature that really stood out to me was the sensor's no-drift control. This ensures that the cursor stays perfectly still when you lift the mouse off the mat, something that's especially crucial during intense firefights in FPS games. The all-new Razer DeathAdder's sensor also has no set maximum speed, which means it won't slow down your movements even at the lowest dpi settings. 

However, the lack of a dedicated DPI button could be a drawback for some users. This means you have to either use the Razer Synapse portal/software to change the DPI or bind one of the side buttons as a DPI button. While this isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, it might be frustrating for gamers who prefer immediate access to their DPI settings. 

The build quality is also commendable - this mouse feels solid in your hand and its ergonomic design ensures maximum comfort during extended gaming sessions. The scroll wheel is smooth and responsive, and the mouse buttons have just the right amount of resistance. 

In conclusion, the Razer Deathadder Essential is a top-of-the-line gaming mouse that offers exceptional performance and comfort. Despite its high price tag, it's worth every penny for serious gamers looking for a reliable and accurate gaming companion.

However, not everything is perfect with this mouse. I wish there was a way to switch directly between profiles without needing to cycle through them all.
