<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=black-gaming-glasses&utm_term=horus-x-blue-light-blocking-glasses-gaming-ultimate-1"><img alt="horus-x-blue-light-blocking-glasses-gaming-ultimate-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/horus-x-blue-light-blocking-glasses-gaming-ultimate-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got the chance to try out the Horus x blue light blocking glasses, and let me tell you, they have been a game-changer for me. As someone who spends hours in front of a screen for work and gaming, I've always suffered from eye strain and fatigue. These glasses, however, have made a significant difference in my day-to-day life. 

The best part about them is their ability to filter out the harmful blue light from screens, which has led to a substantial decrease in my eye strain. I also noticed that I'm less likely to experience headaches after a long day of work or gaming. Not only do they offer practical benefits, but they also look stylish, making them perfect for gaming sessions or long workdays. 

However, there is one downside that I've noticed – the orange tint of the lenses can make colors appear slightly distorted, which might not be the best for tasks that require color accuracy, such as photo editing or graphic design. Additionally, some users might find the glasses to be a bit bulky, but I personally didn't have any issues with comfort. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Horus x blue light blocking glasses for anyone who spends a significant amount of time in front of a screen. They've made a world of difference for me, and I believe they can do the same for you.

I recently purchased a pair of Swanwick's Classic Night Swannies, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The glasses were made to increase sleepiness at bedtime, and they work like magic! I used to struggle with sleeping, but since I started using these glasses, I've had a much easier time falling asleep and waking up feeling more rested.

One of the things that I love most about these glasses is how easy they are to use. Simply put them on a few hours before bedtime, and they'll help you get ready for a good night's sleep. Plus, they come with a nice case and cleaning cloth, making it easy to keep them in tip-top shape. 

The only downside to these glasses is that they're a bit expensive. However, I believe the investment is worth it, especially when it comes to improving your overall health and well-being. 

Overall, I highly recommend Swanwick's Classic Night Swannies to anyone looking for a simple and effective way to improve their sleep quality.

### [GUNNAR Intercept - Premium Gaming Eyewear](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=black-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-intercept-premium-gaming-eyewear)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=black-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1"><img alt="gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-intercept-gaming-glasses-onyx-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the pleasure of trying out GUNNAR's Intercept gaming glasses in onyx. As a gamer myself, I was excited to see how these glasses would impact my overall gaming experience. The first thing that struck me about the Intercepts was their sleek design. Not only do they look great, but they're also incredibly comfortable. The lightweight frame and curved nose rests ensure that they sit perfectly on my face, without causing any discomfort. 

One of the standout features of these glasses is their patented lens technology. It's designed to limit air currents near the eyes, preventing irritation and reducing eye strain. I've spent countless hours gaming with the Intercepts on, and I've noticed a significant improvement in my focus and visual clarity. The high-index lens material eliminates distortion from impurities and haze, ensuring that everything I see on screen is crystal clear. 

Another feature that I really appreciate is the lens tint. It filters blue light and blocks UV, which not only enhances contrast but also protects my eyes from harmful rays. Additionally, the lens coatings reduce glare and reflective light, helping to eliminate visual distractions and stress. 

However, I did encounter a few minor issues with the Intercepts. Firstly, the lenses tend to reflect light in certain lighting conditions, which can be a bit distracting at times. Secondly, the shape of the glasses may not be to everyone's taste, as they have a more masculine design. Finally, while the glasses are comfortable, they can become slightly uncomfortable when worn with larger headphones. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the GUNNAR Intercept gaming glasses to anyone looking to enhance their gaming experience and reduce eye strain. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. So if you're in the market for a new pair of gaming glasses, be sure to give the Intercepts a try! 


### [Blue Light Blocking Computer Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=black-gaming-glasses&utm_term=blue-light-blocking-computer-glasses)

I recently got myself a pair of Livho 2 Pack Blue Light Blocking Glasses, and I must say, they've made quite a difference in my daily screen time routine. The amber lenses are not only stylish but also help in reducing eye strain, blurred vision, and those dreaded headaches that come from long hours in front of the computer. 

One of the things that stood out to me about these glasses is how they've improved my sleep. The blue light blocking feature ensures that my body isn't tricked into thinking it's still daylight, allowing me to fall asleep more easily even after a late-night Netflix binge. 

However, there's one thing that could be improved - the lenses seem to attract smudges and fingerprints quite easily, which can be a little annoying at times. 

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend these glasses to anyone who spends a significant amount of time in front of screens. Not only do they help alleviate eye strain, but they also promote better sleep quality, making them a worthwhile addition to anyone's daily life.

I recently got my hands on the Game Hero gaming glasses, and let me tell you, they have become a staple in my gaming sessions. As a gamer who loves to play for hours on end, I was excited to try out these glasses that claim to reduce fatigue and improve visibility. 

After using them for a few weeks, I can confidently say that they have made a significant difference in my gameplay. The enhanced contrast of colors made the game environments more vibrant and realistic, allowing me to spot enemies and navigate through levels with ease. 

One of the standout features of these glasses is their lightweight design, which ensures that they don't feel cumbersome during extended play sessions. Additionally, the included microfiber cleaning cloth ensures that my glasses stay smudge-free, maintaining optimal visibility at all times. 

However, there's one minor drawback I experienced: the yellow tint can be slightly off-putting at first, making colors appear warmer than they actually are. But once I adjusted to it, the benefits far outweighed this minor inconvenience.

They may not be perfect, but their performance has definitely earned them a place on my list of essential gaming gear.

These glasses have been a game-changer in reducing eye strain and migraines. Their unique lens technology offers clarity while filtering out harmful blue light, making sure my vision stays sharp and comfortable.

The polished metal frame not only looks stylish but also provides a comfortable fit for extended periods of wear. These glasses have passed the 48-hour ongoing reliability test, proving their durability and ability to withstand daily wear and tear. 

However, one minor drawback I've noticed is that the frame can bend easily, so it's essential to handle them with care. I also find that the nose pads can become slightly uncomfortable after wearing the glasses for extended periods. 

In conclusion, GUDVUE's blue light glasses have made a significant difference in reducing eye strain while providing a stylish and comfortable fit for daily use. I highly recommend them for anyone spending long hours in front of screens. 


### [Black Ergonomic Gaming Glasses](https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=black-gaming-glasses&utm_term=black-ergonomic-gaming-glasses)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpgames/amazon/black-gaming-glasses?utm_source=serpgames&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.games&utm_content=black-gaming-glasses&utm_term=gunnar-technology-eyewear-lightning-bolt-360-temple-packs-6-siege-1"><img alt="gunnar-technology-eyewear-lightning-bolt-360-temple-packs-6-siege-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/gunnar-technology-eyewear-lightning-bolt-360-temple-packs-6-siege-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I'll start by saying that I've been using this pair of Gunnar's black gaming glasses for quite some time now. I'm a gamer myself and I can confirm that they are indeed the most versatile pair of glasses out there. The Lightning Bolt 360 was designed with a special emphasis on relieving pressure on the temple region when wearing headsets. This is especially important for me as I often use heavy-duty gaming headphones which can really put a strain on your ears after prolonged use. 

One of the key features that stands out is their modular design. The glasses come with interchangeable parts, including different types of arm temples (light weight plastic, thin metal, and a strap), and multiple nose clips. This allows you to customize the fit to your own comfort level and face shape. The glasses also come with a high-quality case that can store all these modular accessories, making it convenient to carry them around. 

Now, onto the cons. Some users have reported that changing the lenses can be a bit tricky and might even weaken the frame, increasing the risk of it breaking. However, I've not had this problem myself. However, it's worth noting that these glasses are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Due to their larger frame and unique interchangeability mechanism, people with smaller noses or faces might find them slightly uncomfortable or ill-fitting. 

In conclusion, the Gunnar Technology Eyewear Lightning Bolt 360 offers a unique blend of style, comfort, and versatility. Its modular design and interchangeable parts make it stand out from other gaming glasses in the market. However, it's not perfect and there are some potential issues with the lens replacement process and the overall fit.
